"""Every runtime_options key the gateway HANDLES must be in its allowlist.

The unknown-field rejection runs BEFORE the per-key handlers, so a handled key
that is missing from `let supported = [...]` is dead code in the shipped binary:
the field is documented, the handler compiles, every test that builds the options
struct directly still passes, and the caller gets
`unsupported runtime_options fields: <key>`.

That shipped in 0.8.24 for BOTH `mob_composition` and `declare_spec_update`. It
was found by a consumer sending the documented line to the published artifact,
not by any test. This gate is ten lines of comparison that would have caught both
before the tag; it exists because enumerating beats remembering.
