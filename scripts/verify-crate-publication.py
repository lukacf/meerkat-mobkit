"""Every workspace member must be explicitly published or explicitly not.

MobKit publishes exactly one crate, `meerkat-mobkit`, named in a hand-written
`-p` flag in release.yml. `mobkit-store-conformance` carried no `publish` key at
all, so it read as publishable to every tool and every reader while never having
been published at any version. Nothing could tell that apart from an accidental
omission, in either direction.

The published set is DERIVED from release.yml rather than restated here. A second
hand-maintained list would drift from the first and the drift would be invisible
until a release, which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
