// How an e2e suite starts a Rust example backend.
//
// By default this is exactly what the suites have always done: ask cargo to
// build and run the example. CI wants to build the meerkat-mobkit dependency
// graph ONCE and hand the resulting binaries to several parallel jobs, which
// requires the suites to be able to exec a path instead.
//
// Handing `cargo run --example X` a bare prebuilt binary does not work: cargo
// recomputes freshness from target/.fingerprint before running, so given only
// the output file it rebuilds and the uploaded artifact is paid for and then
// ignored. The suite has to bypass cargo, not be given a warmer cargo.
//
// MOBKIT_EXAMPLE_BIN_DIR - directory of prebuilt example binaries. Unset, which
// is the local-development default, changes nothing.
