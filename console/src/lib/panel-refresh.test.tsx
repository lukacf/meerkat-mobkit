/**
 * Panel data refreshes are event-driven. On a server slower than the event
 * rate they used to overlap without limit: every tool or lifecycle frame from
 * any agent re-queried topology (and every other docked panel kind), even for
 * panels in hidden tabs, until the browser's per-origin connection limit
 * starved every other console request. These pin the contract: hidden panels
 * are not refreshed, and a visible panel has at most one request in flight,
 * with requests made meanwhile coalesced into one trailing refresh.
