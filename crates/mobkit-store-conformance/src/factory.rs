//! Store factories: how the conformance chapters obtain store handles.
//!
//! Every chapter takes a factory instead of a store handle so the suite can
//! model a process restart: calling `open` again must return a **new handle
//! over the same underlying storage**. For persistent backends (a SQLite
//! file, a remote dataset) that means a fresh client over the same durable
//! medium; for deliberately non-persistent backends (in-memory stores)
//! returning a handle that shares state (e.g. a clone of one `Arc`) is the
//! correct model.
//!
//! Chapters assume the factory's underlying storage starts **empty**. Use
//! one factory per chapter invocation for the cleanest failure isolation.
