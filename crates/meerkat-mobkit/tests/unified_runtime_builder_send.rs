#![allow(clippy::expect_used)]
//! `UnifiedRuntimeBuilder::build()` returns a `Send` future, so a host can
//! `tokio::spawn(builder.build())` or drive it under a harness that requires
//! `Send`. The check is structural (auto traits follow field and await types),
//! so these fail to compile if a non-`Sync` builder field comes back while
//! `build` holds `&self` across an await, or if anything `build` awaits holds
//! a borrow in a way the compiler cannot prove `Send` for every lifetime.
