//! In-process retry of a stalled explicit mob resume.
//!
//! Activating a prepared mob runs Meerkat's explicit Resume. Meerkat bounds
//! each observation of that operation by a compile-time patience window: when
//! one member's host-owned work makes no observable progress for that long,
//! the caller receives [`MobError::LifecycleOperationProgressStalled`]. The
//! operation itself is not abandoned. It stays registered as the current
//! process-owned Resume for the handle's command authority, its driver task
//! keeps running, and a later `MobHandle::resume` on the same handle joins it
//! instead of starting a new one.
//!
//! On a memory-starved host one member can legitimately exceed the window.
//! Treating the stall as fatal shuts the runtime down and restarts the whole
//! boot from scratch, which re-does exactly the work that was slow. This loop
//! re-joins instead, for as long as the operation keeps moving: every stall
//! names the member and stage it stopped at, and a changed member or stage is
//! progress. Only [`ActivationStallPolicy::max_consecutive_stalls`] stalls in a
//! row at the same point, or the overall stall cap, give up.
