//! Run one unit test as the only test of a child process of its own binary.
//!
//! A few tests assert on meerkat's process-wide cost counters (full
//! transcript graph validations, content-digest bytes) that have no per-test
//! scope in the pinned meerkat release. Under the threaded `cargo test`
//! harness every other test that validates or digests moves those counters,
//! and the SQLite stores under test do that work on blocking worker threads,
//! so a thread-local count would miss the very work being asserted on. Such a
//! test re-runs itself here: in the child it is the only test, so the
//! process-wide counters see its work alone, at full assertion strength, under
//! both `cargo test` and nextest.
