//! Shared gateway construction seams (doctrine D2: converge construction,
//! merge binaries later).
//!
//! The K1/K2 field failures came from the two gateway binaries embedding the
//! same `UnifiedRuntime` with DIVERGENT wiring — `rpc_gateway` built the full
//! identity substrate, `mobkit_gateway` built none. Every piece both binaries
//! must construct identically belongs here so the drift class is structural
//! history. The full store construction converges with the 0.8 binary merge;
//! v1 shares the identity substrate, whose divergence caused the field
//! failures.
