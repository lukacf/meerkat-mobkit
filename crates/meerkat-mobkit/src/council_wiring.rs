//! Temporary-council store wiring.
//!
//! Councils are a meerkat-mob capability: one `council` tool call seats forked
//! participants, runs bounded exchanges, merges and tears the temporary mob
//! down. `meerkat_mob_mcp::MobMcpState` owns the store and defaults it to an
//! IN-MEMORY implementation, so before this module a MobKit gateway lost every
//! council record on restart - including the unfinished ones that
//! `TemporaryCouncilStore::list_unfinished` exists to recover.
//!
//! MobKit supplies its own store rather than calling
//! `MobMcpState::with_persistent_storage_root`. That helper would also flip
//! forked-participant custody and realm profiles to durable in the same call:
//! three behaviour changes bundled as one, two of them unrelated to councils
//! and each with its own recovery semantics. Supplying one store keeps the
//! change to the thing it claims to change.
//!
//! The path comes from [`crate::MobKitStorageLayout::council_db`], which means
//! the file is a registered [`crate::storage_layout::DatabaseSlot`] and is seen
//! by `storage doctor` and `storage migrate` like every other MobKit database.
//! A durable store outside that enumeration would be a second authority.
