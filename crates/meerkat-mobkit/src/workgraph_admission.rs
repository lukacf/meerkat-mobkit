//! Shared admission control for WorkGraph attention-binding mutations.
//!
//! # Upstream subsumption (ask 25; verified against meerkat 0.8.22)
//!
//! Upstream landed an active-binding-per-target invariant INSIDE the store as
//! ask 25 (mobkit's own earlier note dates it to 0.7.25; every line/behaviour
//! cited here was re-verified against 0.8.22):
//! `active_target_occupant_tx` / `active_target_occupant_in`
//! (meerkat-workgraph/src/store.rs) run in the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
//! transaction as the mutation they guard, on all five attention-ADMITTING
//! store paths (`insert_goal`, `insert_attention_for_existing_item`,
//! `update_attention_cas`, `reassign_attention_cas`,
//! `update_item_and_attention_cas`), and raise a typed
//! `WorkGraphError::Conflict` naming the occupant. That is race-free next to
//! the data, so for the case it covers it is strictly stronger than anything
//! this module can do; upstream's own comment sanctions the consequence
//! ("mobkit admission guards demote to defense-in-depth").
//!
//! Enumeration control (every writer of `workgraph_attention` was walked, not
//! just the guarded ones): the other two writers are unguarded on purpose and
//! cannot admit a new duplicate. `rebuild_projection_from_events` replays the
//! event log through `upsert_attention_tx` - that REPLAYS history, including
//! whatever duplicates predate the invariant, which is the "legacy rows"
//! route upstream's own overlay comment names; and
//! `normalize_attention_for_terminal_items_tx` upserts only `Stopped`
//! bindings, which cannot occupy. Neither is an admission seam, so neither
//! changes the split below.
//!
//! The store guard covers exactly one case: an ACTIVE candidate against an
//! ACTIVE occupant whose `WorkAttentionTarget::target_key()` is
//! byte-identical. Three gaps keep this module load-bearing, not redundant:
//!
//! 1. PAUSED. The probe returns early unless the candidate is `Active`, and
//!    its occupant filter is `status = 'active'`. Pause A, create B on the
//!    same target, let A's deadline pass: two Active bindings, both admitted.
//! 2. CROSS-SPELLING TARGETS. `target_key()` is `session:<id>` for the
//!    `Session` arm but `owner:session:<id>` for a `LoweredOwner` carrying a
//!    session-kind owner key - two distinct keys to the guard, one session to
//!    `attention_target_matches_session` (meerkat/src/surface.rs).
//!    Both spellings are reachable from the wire (`GoalAttentionTarget::Owner`
//!    with a `WorkOwnerKey::session(..)` key); upstream's own regression test
//!    `attention_overlay_arbitrates_multiple_active_bindings_newest_wins`
//!    builds exactly that pair and DEGRADES rather than refusing it.
//! 3. SESSION-IDENTITY ALIASING. Likewise `session:<id>` versus
//!    `owner:agent:mob/<mob>/agent/<identity>` for one member: two keys to the
//!    store guard, one member to `attention_target_matches_session`.
//!
//! The CONSEQUENCE of an admitted duplicate also changed under the same ask,
//! and the old, louder rationale for this module is no longer true:
//! `MultipleActiveBindings` is gone. The turn overlay arbitrates newest-binding-wins
//! (`created_at`, binding id as tie-break) with a `tracing::error!`
//! diagnostic instead of failing every scoped turn. A duplicate therefore no
//! longer BRICKS the member - it silently STARVES the losing binding, whose
//! goal stays Active and durable while never reaching its target. Refusing at
//! admission turns that silent starvation back into a refusal the caller sees.
//!
//! The cross-process sidecar cannot be dropped in favour of the upstream
//! guard either: the three residual cases are still check-then-act across two
//! separate reads, so without the sidecar two processes sharing one
//! `workgraph.sqlite3` can each observe a free target and both proceed.
//!
//! What remains here, then, is defense-in-depth for the exact-key
//! Active/Active case and the PRIMARY refusal for the three residuals: the
//! occupancy check (with session↔identity alias resolution through the mob
//! roster and the shared session store's member-binding metadata), the
//! in-process gate serializing every check-then-act window, and — for
//! SQLite-backed stores that two processes may share — a cross-process
//! sidecar lock.
//!
//! One [`WorkGraphAdmission`] exists per [`MobRuntime`](crate::MobRuntime).
//! Every surface that can mint an attention binding must go through it:
//! - the `mobkit/workgraph/*` RPC arms (unified stdin + console) for
//!   `goal/create`, `attention/resume` and `attention/reassign`;
//! - the AGENT TOOL plane: `ScopePinnedWorkGraphTools` intercepts
//!   `workgraph_attention_reassign` through a late-bound
//!   [`WorkGraphAdmissionSlot`] that `MobRuntime::bootstrap` fills (the
//!   tool wrapper is constructed before the mob — and thus the roster —
//!   exists). An unfilled slot (non-mob embedder) forwards without a mobkit
//!   pre-check; since ask 25 that forward still meets the store's own
//!   exact-key guard, so the duplicate it used to admit is now refused
//!   upstream (pinned by
//!   `workgraph_wiring::tests::unfilled_admission_slot_forwards_reassign_unguarded`),
//!   with the three residuals above left unguarded on that path.
//!
//! A surface that checked without holding the gate would race the others
//! past the check; a surface that skipped the check (the round-3 tool-plane
//! hole) would both starve a goal and invert authority — an agent doing
//! what an ABAC-granted operator is refused.
//!
//! # Target spelling: normalize at write, alias at read (round-4 Q2, round-5 S1)
//!
//! The roster is PROCESS-LOCAL, but the SQLite store is documented as
//! shareable by two processes (gateway + library-mode runtime on one state
//! dir). A guard that needed the roster to equate a session-form row with an
//! identity-form check would be alias-blind in the process that doesn't know
//! the member — and in-process while a member is mid-respawn (absent from
//! the roster). So mobkit normalizes at WRITE instead: every mutation that
//! points a binding at a target (`goal/create` and `attention/reassign` on
//! the RPC arms, `workgraph_attention_reassign` on the tool plane) first
//! lowers a session target that resolves to a member of THIS mob to its
//! OWNER form (`mob/<mob>/agent/<identity>`) via
//! `WorkGraphAdmission::lower_member_session_target`. Session→member
//! resolution is roster-first with a SHARED-store fallback (round-5 S1): a
//! mob member's session carries its durable identity on
//! `session_metadata.mob_member_binding` (the exact seam meerkat's schedule
//! identity-recovery reads — meerkat 0.8.22,
//! meerkat-mob/src/runtime/builder.rs `persisted_session_matches_member`),
//! and that metadata lives in the session store both processes share — so a
//! roster-BLIND co-process (and this process mid-respawn) still lowers
//! member session targets instead of minting the session-form rows an
//! identity-form occupancy check cannot see. Only when BOTH the roster and
//! the session metadata miss does a target keep its session form — a
//! genuinely non-member session, for which no aliasing exists. Mobkit-created
//! bindings are therefore owner-form whenever a member is involved, and the
//! occupancy check's roster-FREE layer — primary owner-key equality, which
//! for non-member sessions is raw-session-id equality — refuses duplicates
//! without consulting any roster. The same roster-then-store resolution
//! backs the session↔identity aliasing in
//! `WorkGraphAdmission::attention_target_alias_keys`, the EXTRA layer for
//! legacy or CLI-created session-form rows (bindings written by the meerkat
//! CLI directly on a shared store bypass write normalization). The residual
//! holes are CLI-written rows for sessions OUTSIDE this mob's session store
//! (no resolution seam exists for them at all), and CLI-written session-form
//! member rows checked from an identity-form target in a process whose
//! roster misses the member — the store carries no identity→session lookup
//! short of a full session scan, so that direction stays roster-only.
//!
//! Round-6: a session can ALSO be spelled as an owner-form target —
//! `{kind:"owner"|"lowered_owner", owner_key:{kind:"session", id:<session>}}`
//! (the store's own `Session`-arm rows canonicalize to exactly that owner
//! key). Write-side lowering therefore keys on the resolved owner key, not
//! on the target VARIANT: `WorkGraphAdmission::lower_member_session_target`
//! canonicalizes a session-kind owner key into the same session resolution
//! path — member sessions lower to owner form, non-member sessions come back
//! in the canonical `{kind:"session"}` arm (identical occupancy key), an id
//! that does not parse as a session id is refused, and store-read failures
//! fail closed exactly as for `{kind:"session"}` targets. A session-kind
//! owner key never reaches the store verbatim; letting one through would
//! store a session-spelled `LoweredOwner` row that an identity-form
//! occupancy check in a roster-blind process cannot see — re-opening the
//! duplicate window normalization exists to close.
//!
//! # Occupancy-scan bounds
//!
//! The occupancy check queries `list_attention` once per occupying status
//! (Active, Paused) with the service's realm and namespace pinned.
//!
//! WHERE THE STATUS FILTER IS APPLIED (0.8.22, and NOT where the store's own
//! code suggests): `WorkGraphService::list_attention`
//! (meerkat-workgraph/src/service.rs) `take()`s the status OUT of the request
//! before calling the store and applies `attention_status_matches_at` itself.
//! The store's exact-matching `attention_status_matches_filter` - and the
//! `status` SQL pushdown under it - therefore never see a status on this
//! path; they are reachable only by driving a `WorkGraphStore` directly,
//! which mobkit never does. `attention_status_matches_at` is
//! ELIGIBILITY-AT-NOW, the same semantics as 0.7.23: it mirrors the
//! `WorkAttentionLifecycleMachine`'s `ClassifyAttentionEligibility` verdict,
//! so an `Active` filter ALSO returns a Paused binding past its deadline, and
//! a `Paused` filter returns paused bindings that are not yet eligible.
//!
//! Two scans are therefore necessary, and their union is exact: scan 1
//! (`Active`) returns Active rows plus Paused rows past their deadline; scan
//! 2 (`Paused { until: None }`) returns the paused rows that are not yet
//! eligible. The union is Active plus EVERY Paused - exactly the set
//! `binding_occupies_target` admits, whichever way the machine rules on
//! `until: None`. The callers keep that predicate as an in-memory recheck so
//! occupancy semantics do not silently follow upstream filter drift.
//!
//! WHAT THE STORE-LEVEL SELECT COSTS. The 0.7.23 full-scan bound is narrowed,
//! not gone. `list_sqlite_attention` gained NULL-tolerant SQL pushdown over
//! the index `(realm_id, namespace, status, target_key)` added by
//! `migration_0002_attention_query_columns` - but on THIS path only realm_id
//! and namespace reach the SQL (the service stripped the status; mobkit
//! passes `target: None`). Each scan still returns every in-scope binding row,
//! including the permanently-accumulating Superseded/Stopped ones, and
//! filters in Rust.
//!
//! That leaves an operator cliff rather than a hole. `list_attention` reads
//! `MAX_COLLECTION_LIMIT + 1` (1001) rows and returns a hard `InvalidInput`
//! above 1000, so once one realm+namespace accumulates 1000 binding rows of
//! ANY status, every admission FAILS CLOSED (refused, never silently
//! admitted) until an operator prunes - `mobkit/workgraph/attention/prune`,
//! the terminal-row GC on the RPC surface, is the remedy. Two scans means
//! that cost is paid twice per admission, while the global gate and the
//! sidecar transaction are held.
