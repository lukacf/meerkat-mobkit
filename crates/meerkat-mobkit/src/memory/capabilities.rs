//! Judgment-plane capability traits (M4 de-weld).
//!
//! The full judgment plane — the §10.1 taint firewall controls, the Steward's
//! dream read/write surface, and the console Memory panel's read API — used
//! to be inherent methods on the bundled [`SqliteAgentMemoryStore`]; every
//! consumer (StewardEngine, `memory_wiring`, the console panel, the builder)
//! was welded to that concrete type. These traits promote that surface so the
//! plane runs against ANY provider that advertises the capability, with the
//! bundled store as just one implementor — the same shape the Distiller
//! (`AgentMemoryProvider` + `TombstoneSource`) and the RecallCoordinator
//! (`SelectedRecordFetch`) already have.
//!
//! Discovery is by capability accessor on [`AgentMemoryProvider`]
//! (`as_taintable`, `as_steward_store`, `as_memory_panel_store`,
//! `as_selected_record_fetch`, `as_tombstone_source`), replacing the deleted
//! `as_sqlite_store()` downcast — the provider trait no longer names its own
//! implementation.
//!
//! Trait cut, deliberately layered:
//! - [`TaintableStore`] stands alone: firewall wiring happens before any
//!   engine exists and is required even when no engine is enabled.
//! - [`StewardStore`] extends [`StagedMemoryStore`] (the dream stages and
//!   commits batches) and [`TombstoneSource`] (the orient phase renders
//!   recent tombstones).
//! - [`MemoryPanelStore`] extends [`StewardStore`]: seven of the panel's
//!   fifteen reads are steward reads, and everything the panel renders
//!   (dream runs, promotions, proposals, harvests) is judgment-plane output
//!   — a provider that can serve the panel can serve the steward. The
//!   supertrait keeps the shared methods defined exactly once instead of
//!   duplicating names across two traits on the same implementor.
//!
//! All row types here are plain portable data (no SQLite types leak).
//!
