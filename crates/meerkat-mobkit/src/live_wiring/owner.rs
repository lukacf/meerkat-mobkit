//! One live voice path per gateway, arbitrated "latest engaged wins".
//!
//! A gateway may register console voice (`runtime_options.console_voice`)
//! and the external live channel (`runtime_options.live`) together. Both
//! doors open member channels through the same [`super::GatewayLiveContext`]
//! (one adapter host, one provider registration, one audio owner), so only
//! one of them may hold an active voice path at a time. Meerkat couples
//! nothing here: channels are per session, and a console call on member B
//! and an external channel on member A are independent upstream. The policy
//! that the newest engagement wins, and the loser learns why, is MobKit's.
//!
//! The arbiter never closes a channel itself. Each engagement carries the
//! closer its own door would use (the console slot's cancel path, the
//! external host's generated close), so a preempted owner is closed through
//! exactly the sequence it would have used to close on its own. A close that
//! fails leaves the previous owner in place and fails the newcomer closed;
//! there is never a silent double owner.
