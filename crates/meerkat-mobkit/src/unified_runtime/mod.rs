/// happens to be waiting. If nobody waits, nobody learns. This probe is the
/// unconditional waiter: every `interval` it sends the cheapest round trip
/// the handle exposes (`QueryPhase`, an O(1) in-memory phase read) and pages
/// `ErrorEvent::ActorLoopStalled` when the reply does not arrive within
/// `budget`.
///
/// At most ONE probe is ever outstanding: on timeout the task stays parked
/// on the SAME round trip until the loop drains it, rather than stacking
/// further commands onto a stalled actor (uncapped retry loops already
/// amplify channel pressure there; the probe must never join them). When the
/// parked round trip finally resolves, recovery is emitted as
/// [`ErrorEvent::ActorLoopRecovered`], correlated to the stall by `stall_id`.
///
/// That variant amends a previously stated invariant — `ErrorEvent` used to
/// have no recovery precedent, on the reasoning that every variant names a
/// failure and the hook is a paging channel. An open-only paging channel is
/// not decidable: a receiver that pages on a stall can never close the
/// incident it opened, so it can only escalate. The resolution is filtered
/// out of error-level logging by the default sink, and unaware consumers see
/// it fall into the `_` arm `#[non_exhaustive]` already forces.
///
/// THE CORRELATED PAIR PLUS THE RECEIVER'S OWN CLOCK IS THE DISCRIMINATOR.
/// An open `stall_id` with no matching resolution after ten minutes is a
/// wedged loop; one closed after fifty seconds was a busy loop. That is a
/// complete decision procedure using only what this emitter already sends,
/// which is why the missing progress counter is an IMPROVEMENT rather than a
/// missing piece: it would let the probe skip PAGING for the busy case at
/// all, whereas today the receiver pages first and decides after. Better,
/// but strictly an optimization of a decision the receiver can already make.
///
/// Note what the counters can and cannot say. Because the probe parks on the
/// SAME round trip rather than starting a new one, a genuinely wedged loop
/// pages exactly once and never gets another cycle, so no counter can climb;
/// a merely slow loop recovers and stalls again, so it is the slow case that
/// accumulates. `prior_resolved_stalls` is therefore chronic-busyness
/// evidence, and "wedged" is the absence of a resolution, measured by the
/// receiver's own clock — not by any count this emitter could produce.
///
/// The probe treats a completion within budget, `Ok` or a typed error the
/// actor ANSWERED with, as a live loop: it measures whether the loop drains,
/// not whether the mob is healthy. The one exception is a channel-closed
/// error ([`actor_terminated_detail`]): that is not the loop answering, it is
/// the loop being gone. It is emitted as [`ErrorEvent::ActorLoopTerminated`],
/// never as a recovery (OB3 2026-09-04 read exactly such a resolution as
/// `actor_loop_recovered` while every later send failed instantly), the
/// shared [`ActorLoopHealth`] is marked terminated so deliveries fail fast,
/// and the probe ends: there is no loop left to watch and nothing in this
/// process can restart it. A terminal phase reply
/// (`Stopped`/`Completed`/`Destroyed`) also ends the probe.
