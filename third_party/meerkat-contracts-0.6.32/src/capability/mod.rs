//! Capability wire projections for Meerkat.
//!
//! The typed capability vocabulary and registry mechanics live in
//! `meerkat-capabilities`. Feature crates submit their own declarations there;
//! this module re-exports the shared types for public contract consumers and
//! owns only the wire response shapes in [`query`].
