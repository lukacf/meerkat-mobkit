// @flow-editor-core — the MobKit Flow Editor's headless controller plane.
//
// Pure projection/transition logic extracted from the legacy
// flow-editor/src/controller.js monolith, module by module. Framework-free:
// no DOM access at load time, no React. The shell bundles this package as
// the window.MobKitFlowCore IIFE and the controller.js bootstrap builds
// window.MobKitFlowController from createMobKitFlowController.
