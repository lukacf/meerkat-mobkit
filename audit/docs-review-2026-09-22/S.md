## SKILL-001: External architecture gotcha incorrectly requires active restore to rotate its lease and run customization on every reconcile

**Severity:** medium. **Decision:** confirmed. **Disposition:** fixed; independently reviewed.

### Original claim and proof

**`.claude/skills/meerkat-architecture/references/gotchas.md:48`**

```text
`retire`/`respawn`/`reset` (and `restore_flow` on every reconcile) depend on the bump, and tests enforce it — `identity_first_runtime_retire_returns_advanced_fencing_token` asserts the returned token advances *and* that old-token writes are then rejected; `restore_flow_releases_active_lease_on_customizer_failure` asserts `restore_flow` refreshes (advances) the active lease before customizer work.
```

Agents following this loaded skill can incorrectly treat healthy active-lease reuse and skipped rebuild customization as defects, reintroducing unnecessary fencing rotation/rebuild work during reconcile and contradicting the current live-authority contract.

**`meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/orchestrator.rs:343-361`**

```text
.embody_identity(
```

Current restore_flow delegates eager restore to the shared IdentityRuntime embodiment path, supplying the spec and optional customizer.

**`meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:5260-5270`**

```text
if state == IdentityLifecycleState::Active {
            // Converged eager restore still validates the time-sensitive
            // external lease. This is part of the shared embodiment door, not
            // a second restore implementation: healthy authority is reused,
            // due authority is renewed, and lost authority parks this member.
            let record = self.reuse_active_restore_state(&spec).await?;
            self.clear_materialization_backoff(identity).await;
            return Ok(EmbodimentOutcome {
```

An already Active identity returns through reuse before fresh acquisition or build customization. The quoted every-reconcile refencing claim is directly contradicted by the executable branch.

**`meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:7183-7196`**

```text
Some(lease) if lease.is_healthy() => return Ok(lease.fencing_token),
```

ensure_active_lease returns the exact healthy fence; it does not call acquire_leases for healthy active authority.

**`meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:7363-7372`**

```text
self.ensure_active_lease(&spec.identity).await?;
```

reuse_active_restore_state validates the existing authority. Due leases enter renewal and use its returned grant; healthy leases remain unchanged.

**`meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9119-9187`**

```text
async fn identity_first_runtime_restore_flow_reuses_exact_active_lease_without_customizing()
```

The current regression test supplies a failing customizer yet expects successful active reuse, asserts the preserved fencing token equals the initial one, and asserts send uses that unchanged token. These are inspected test assertions, not a claim of an executed test run.

**`meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9168-9181`**

```text
.expect("an already-active identity must bypass rebuild customization");
```

The exact current test contract is the opposite of invoking customization after every active restore refence.

**`meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9351-9407`**

```text
async fn identity_first_runtime_restore_flow_renews_expired_active_lease_before_reuse()
```

The separate due-lease test uses a rotating external renewal provider. The correction must preserve that renewal can advance a fence, rather than incorrectly promising that every active restore always retains the same token.

**`meerkat-mobkit/src and meerkat-mobkit/tests:Exact-name search across Rust files`**

```text
restore_flow_releases_active_lease_on_customizer_failure
```

A read-only exact-text scan returned zero matches for the old test name cited by the skill. The current test name and assertions are shown above.

### Independent adjudication

Independently traced restore_flow into embody_identity_locked, then the Active early return into reuse_active_restore_state and ensure_active_lease. The executable branch precedes both acquire_leases and customize_build, so the every-reconcile claim is false, not merely an obsolete test name. The actual healthy-reuse test installs a customizer that would fail and asserts successful restore with unchanged fencing and send tokens. The due-lease test deliberately rotates on renewal and requires the new token, so an unconditional 'active restores never rotate' replacement would also be false. The correction must distinguish healthy reuse from provider renewal and explicit lifecycle reacquisition. Source/tests were read from the actual MobKit checkout at af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc and verified unchanged against that baseline. These are inspected source/test assertions, not executed Rust test results. The old upstream audit pin and this Meerkat baseline have identical gotchas.md bytes, confirming the fix is not duplicated there.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/orchestrator.rs:343-380`**

```text
spec: Some(&spec),
                                    customizer,
```

restore_flow passes both values into the shared embodiment path. Its error arm parks a failed member as Broken rather than failing unrelated members.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:5260-5282`**

```text
let record = self.reuse_active_restore_state(&spec).await?;
            self.clear_materialization_backoff(identity).await;
            return Ok(EmbodimentOutcome {
```

Already-Active embodiments return before the fresh acquisition and customization path.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:7183-7263`**

```text
Some(lease) if lease.is_healthy() => return Ok(lease.fencing_token),
```

Healthy authority is returned unchanged. Non-healthy authority calls renew_leases, publishes the returned grant, and reports LeaseLost on a Lost/missing response. No acquire_leases call occurs here.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9119-9203`**

```text
preserved_lease.fencing_token, initial_grant.fencing_token,
```

A deliberately failing customizer is bypassed; restore succeeds, the exact lease stays held, and subsequent send uses the initial token.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9351-9407`**

```text
renewed.fencing_token > initial_grant.fencing_token,
```

ControlledLeaseProvider is configured with RenewRotatedToken. The test requires one renewal and subsequent send using the renewed grant, not retention of the expired fence.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9410-9463`**

```text
assert_eq!(status.state, IdentityLifecycleState::Broken);
    assert!(status.lease.is_none());
```

Lost active authority yields a per-member Broken result and preserves the previous spec; 'fails closed' is not a claim that the fleet-level restore call must fail.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:5333-5341,5402-5404`**

```text
let customize = customizer.customize_build(&build_context, &spec, &mut draft);
```

The fresh-materialization branch acquires its grant at 5337-5341, before invoking arbitrary customizer code at 5404; this ordering remains documented.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/local_lease.rs:83-108,139-146`**

```text
let token = FencingToken::new(state.next_token);
            state.next_token += 1;
```

Explicit same-holder acquisition still issues a fresh token. Local renewal instead returns the existing matching token; neither behavior should be conflated with unconditional restore reacquisition.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:3799-3835`**

```text
token > old_grant.fencing_token,
```

The retained retire regression explicitly requires an advanced fence and rejects snapshot writes under the old grant. Runtime lifecycle reacquisition sites at 9065, 9639, 9848, and 10072 are unchanged.

**`lukacf/meerkat-mobkit@af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc:meerkat-mobkit/src/unified_runtime/builder.rs:1229-1242`**

```text
Arc::new(LocalLeaseProvider::with_floor(high_water)),
```

The builder reads the persisted high-water from LocalContinuityStore::open_with_fencing_floor and seeds the provider; local_lease.rs:63-66 initializes next_token above that floor. Preserve the existing historical restart-floor caveat without changing runtime code.

**Required correction:** Edit only upstream gotchas item 37. Name LocalLeaseProvider for the explicit-acquire rule; retain retire/respawn/reset refencing and its current retire test. Replace every-reconcile rotation/customization claims and the removed test with the healthy Active reuse, due-provider-renewal, and lost-authority distinction plus the two current restore regression names. State that fresh materialization still acquires before customization. Remove the continuity-token-churn aside, retain the same-holder non-idempotence warning for explicit reacquisition, scope the existing lifecycle orphan-on-retry caveat to the bundled single-process provider, and preserve the existing restart-floor guidance.

### Changes and final verification

**Changed:** `.claude/skills/meerkat-architecture/references/gotchas.md`.

Corrected only item 37 (one physical line) in the isolated upstream Meerkat worktree. Explicit LocalLeaseProvider acquisition still refences, including lifecycle reacquisition. Already-Active restore instead keeps a healthy exact grant without build customization; due grants renew through the provider and may rotate, and lost authority fails closed. Fresh materialization acquires before customization. Replaced the removed test with the two current restore regression names, removed the every-reconcile churn claim, and scoped the existing lifecycle orphan caveat to the bundled provider. The historical restart-floor paragraph tail is byte-for-byte unchanged.

**Validation:** PASS: make SHELL=/bin/bash agent-gate AGENT_GATE_ARGS=--working-tree; git diff --check; read-only Python assertions prove only line 48 changed in exactly one tracked file, stale assertions are absent, all three cited tests exist, five MobKit source/test files exactly match af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc, audit-S preserves the original discovery object verbatim, and scope-S JSON parses. Fresh read-only review: PASS with no regressions (review-S.json). The parent additionally reports executing ./scripts/repo-cargo test -p meerkat-mobkit --test identity_first_runtime identity_first_runtime_restore_flow_ --locked: all 28 tests PASSED, with linker compact-unwind size warnings only. No duplicate Rust run was performed in this upstream worktree.

**Final review: pass.** The correction accurately distinguishes healthy Active restore reuse from due-lease renewal, lost authority, and explicit lifecycle reacquisition. Independent inspection of executable source confirms that the Active branch returns before acquisition and customization; healthy authority preserves its exact fence, due authority invokes provider renewal, and lost authority becomes a member-local Broken outcome before publishing the requested spec. The inspected regression tests assert these distinctions, including bypassing a deliberately failing customizer. Explicit LocalLeaseProvider acquisitions still advance fencing, lifecycle operations still reacquire, and fresh materialization still acquires before customization. Persisted restart-floor guidance remains valid and its historical paragraph tail is byte-for-byte preserved. Exactly item 37 at line 48 changed; the obsolete claims and nonexistent test citation are removed, and all three current test citations exist. No significant issues found in the reviewed changes.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-didactic-train/.claude/skills/meerkat-architecture/references/gotchas.md:48`**

```text
For an already `Active` identity, `restore_flow` instead reuses the exact healthy live lease and skips build customization; due authority is renewed through the provider and may return a newer fence, while lost authority fails closed.
```

The replacement states the implementation's conditional behavior rather than promising either unconditional rotation or unconditional token preservation.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:5260-5282`**

```text
let record = self.reuse_active_restore_state(&spec).await?;
            self.clear_materialization_backoff(identity).await;
            return Ok(EmbodimentOutcome {
```

External MobKit implementation, verified byte-identical to af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc: the Active branch returns before fresh acquisition at 5337-5341 and customize_build at 5404.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:7183-7263`**

```text
Some(lease) if lease.is_healthy() => return Ok(lease.fencing_token),
```

Healthy authority returns the existing token directly. The remaining branch calls renew_leases and publishes its returned grant; Lost or missing renewal results call mark_lease_lost and return LeaseLost. The inspected health predicate at 957-960 uses remaining TTL, so 'due' is not restricted to already-expired grants.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/orchestrator.rs:343-380`**

```text
let failure = runtime
                                    .park_embodiment_failure(&identity, &error)
                                    .await;
```

restore_flow delegates to embody_identity with the requested spec and customizer. Its error arm produces RestoreOutcome::Broken for that member instead of propagating the member failure as a fleet-level error.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9119-9203`**

```text
preserved_lease.fencing_token, initial_grant.fencing_token,
```

Inspected, not executed: identity_first_runtime_restore_flow_reuses_exact_active_lease_without_customizing supplies a customizer whose body returns BuildFailed, requires successful Resumed restore, asserts exact fence equality, asserts subsequent send uses that same fence, and checks another holder cannot acquire the preserved lease.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9351-9407`**

```text
renewed.fencing_token > initial_grant.fencing_token,
```

Inspected, not executed: the cited renewal test selects RenewRotatedToken, asserts one renewal, and requires subsequent send to use the renewed fence. The provider's actual implementation at 650-655 allocates and installs the newer token, supporting 'may return a newer fence' rather than mandatory rotation for all providers.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:9410-9463`**

```text
assert_eq!(status.state, IdentityLifecycleState::Broken);
    assert!(status.lease.is_none());
```

Inspected, not executed: lost renewal must produce a member-local Broken outcome while the fleet pass succeeds, remove the lease, and retain the old spec label. Actual mark_lease_lost source likewise sets Broken and clears the lease; reuse_active_restore_state validates authority before updating entry.spec.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/local_lease.rs:83-146`**

```text
let token = FencingToken::new(state.next_token);
            state.next_token += 1;
```

The acquisition body rejects a different holder but reaches this allocation for the same holder, preserving explicit reacquisition fencing. In contrast, local renewal returns the existing matching record token. The correction correctly scopes the acquisition rule to LocalLeaseProvider.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/identity_first/runtime.rs:7266-7281`**

```text
entry.state = state;
        entry.lease = None;
```

The retained lifecycle caveat describes actual state clearing. Inspected retire, respawn, live-respawn rebind, and reset bodies at 9045-9067, 9633-9641, 9843-9850, and 10066-10074 call this lifecycle transition before explicit acquire_leases. The wording remains limited to the bundled single-process provider.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/tests/identity_first_runtime.rs:3799-3835`**

```text
token > old_grant.fencing_token,
```

Inspected, not executed: the retained retire test requires a higher returned token and calls assert_old_token_snapshot_write_rejected. That helper's actual body at 2023-2046 attempts a snapshot write under the old token and requires ContinuityStoreError::StaleFencingToken.

**`/Users/luka/src/copilot-worktrees/meerkat-mobkit/luka-crnkovicfriis-abk-literate-guacamole/meerkat-mobkit/src/unified_runtime/builder.rs:1229-1242`**

```text
Arc::new(LocalLeaseProvider::with_floor(high_water)),
```

The builder obtains the persisted high-water through open_with_fencing_floor and supplies it to LocalLeaseProvider. The inspected provider constructor initializes next_token with floor.saturating_add(1), supporting the retained distinction between restart-floor recovery and same-process reacquisition.
