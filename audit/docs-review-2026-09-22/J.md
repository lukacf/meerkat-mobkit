# J: Archive, historical evidence, proposals and plans

[Audit index](README.md) | [Coverage](coverage.md)

Original documentation and initial evidence line ranges refer to baseline `af82b6b3ab34faed9bf3e962d148d55f10dcd1dc`, unless an external dependency or historical revision is explicitly identified. Final-review citations refer to the corrected files in this change. Source excerpts may be de-indented or omit intervening lines; cited ranges identify the complete context. Quoted defects are preserved as evidence, not current usage guidance.

No actionable defects were found. The independent adjudicator challenged archive coverage and historical framing without inventing current-code requirements for old proposals.
