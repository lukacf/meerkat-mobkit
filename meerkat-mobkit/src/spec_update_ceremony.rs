//! The explicit authority transition for a persistent mob definition.
//!
//! Initial creation is exclusively Meerkat's `MobCreated` event at definition
//! epoch 1. Ordinary resume never updates authority: it reads and verifies the
//! latest canonical definition from Meerkat's event log, with the spec store
//! serving only as a checked projection.
//!
//! This ceremony is the sole sanctioned update path. An explicit operator
//! declaration compare-and-swaps the observed canonical definition epoch through
//! [`meerkat_mob::MobStorage::update_definition`]. Meerkat atomically appends the
//! successor `MobDefinitionUpdated` authority event and converges its spec
//! projection. MobKit does not perform a projection-only resume update, append
//! raw events, rewrite creation provenance, or emit `MobCompleted`.
//!
//! Deliberately two-phase. [`propose_spec_update`] only READS, and reports what
//! an update would change; [`commit_spec_update`] writes. A single call that
//! silently accepted whatever it found would be indistinguishable from not
//! having the pin at all, and the point is that config evolution becomes a
//! DECLARED transition rather than refused drift.
//!
//! The compare-and-swap is not decoration. Between proposing and committing,
//! another process can run its own ceremony; the revision makes a stale
//! declaration fail closed instead of overwriting a definition the operator
//! never saw. The write routes only through [`meerkat_mob::MobStorage`], so
//! MobMachine authority, the canonical event, and the spec projection remain one
//! upstream-owned transaction.
