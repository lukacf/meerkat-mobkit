//! Shared polling backstop for tests that guard STRUCTURAL properties.
//!
//! A structural property is one that either happens or never will: a
//! background task rotates a lease, a read model self-heals, a frame lands in
//! the store. Guarding one with `sleep(fixed); assert!(happened)` does not
//! measure correctness - it measures whether the runner got around to polling
//! the task inside that window. Standalone it passes; under full-suite
//! parallelism the same code fails, and the failure is indistinguishable from
//! a real regression, so the suite trains everyone to rerun instead of read.
//!
//! [`poll_until`] replaces that shape. The ceiling is a hang backstop, never a
//! measurement, so it is deliberately generous; on expiry the panic names the
//! thing that never happened rather than reporting a bare timeout.
//!
//! Note what this is NOT for. A test whose assertion is NEGATIVE ("no renewal
//! happened in this window", "the probe stayed idle") is genuinely temporal:
//! the window has to be long enough that a buggy implementation would have
//! acted. Load only makes those safer. Leave them alone.
