//! Real durable transcript fork, exposed through [`UnifiedRuntime`].
//!
//! This is a WRAPPER over meerkat 0.8.22's `MobHandle::fork_member`
//! (`meerkat-mob/src/runtime/handle.rs:9343`). It reimplements no transcript,
//! cache, identity or blob logic - all four remain owned by the persistent
//! session service behind `SessionService::fork_persisted_session`.
//!
//! # What upstream guarantees, and what it refuses
//!
//! Read this before changing anything here; the contract is upstream's, not
//! MobKit's.
//!
//! - The child transcript is a REAL durable fork. `message_count = None`
//!   selects the source's exact committed transcript end while the persistent
//!   session owner holds its mutation guard; an explicit count selects that
//!   prefix and is REFUSED if it splits a tool-use/result group.
//! - The fork COMMITS BEFORE resume provisioning. If provisioning then fails,
//!   `MobError::ForkMemberProvisionFailed` retains the durable
//!   `fork_session_id` so the branch stays recoverable instead of being
//!   silently deleted. That typed shape (and its
//!   `structured_data()["recovery"] == "resume_committed_fork_session"`) is
//!   the ENTIRE recoverability affordance - see
//!   [`ForkMemberError::structured_data`]. Never flatten it to a string.
//! - Running-source rejection is upstream's: `SessionError::Busy` becomes
//!   `MobError::ForkSourceUnavailable { cause: Running }`, and a source with
//!   no session becomes `cause: NoSession`. MobKit passes both through
//!   verbatim in [`ForkMemberError::Mob`] and never reclassifies them.
//! - Self-fork is refused upstream (`MobError::MemberAlreadyExists`), and a
//!   `SpawnMemberSpec::placement` is refused with `MobError::WiringError`
//!   ("durable fork resume currently requires the source session store's
//!   controlling host"). Those guards are deliberately NOT duplicated here:
//!   a second copy would drift from upstream's.
//!
//! # The cache boundary
//!
//! Upstream constructs the child's `DurableSessionForkTarget` with
//! `cache_identity: None` (handle.rs:9368-9380) because profile resolution and
//! resume override masks are actor-owned and happen AFTER the handle admits
//! the spawn. Every mob fork therefore reports
//! `ForkCacheInheritance::Unavailable { reason: TargetIdentityUnresolved }`.
//!
//! MobKit passes `cache_inheritance` through VERBATIM and must never try to
//! make inheritance available: resolving a profile/model into a
//! `SessionLlmIdentity` to enable it is exactly the cache logic this wrapper
//! is forbidden to reimplement, and persisting evidence a later profile
//! override could invalidate is how a cache breakpoint becomes a lie.
//!
//! # MobKit-owned wrapping
//!
//! Only three things are MobKit's here, and each mirrors
//! [`UnifiedRuntime::spawn`](crate::unified_runtime::UnifiedRuntime::spawn):
//!
//! 1. Aliases. Wire-facing member ids are public aliases; the mob roster
//!    speaks comms-safe encoded ids. Source and child both route through
//!    [`crate::member_comms_id`], so a fork addresses the same roster
//!    identities a spawn would.
//! 2. Source lifecycle authority. When an identity runtime is SUPPLIED AT THE
//!    CALL or installed on the runtime (in that precedence - see
//!    [`UnifiedRuntime::fork_member_with_identity_runtime`]), the fork runs
//!    inside the source alias's tracked lifecycle target, so a stale, deleted
//!    or mid-lifecycle source alias is refused before the durable read - the
//!    same guard `mobkit/fork_helper` already carries, resolved the same way.
//!    The child's raw-namespace reservation is taken SECOND, matching durable
//!    materialization's lock order, so the two cannot deadlock by inversion.
//! 3. The shared error hook, fired exactly as `spawn` fires it.
