//! Shared observation of the mob actor loop's liveness.
//!
//! meerkat's mob actor is ONE serialized command loop. The unified runtime's
//! probe (`run_actor_loop_probe`) is the only unconditional witness of that
//! loop, and until now its verdict lived solely in the paging channel
//! (`ErrorEvent::ActorLoopStalled` / `ActorLoopRecovered`). The delivery path
//! could not see it: a send issued while a stall was open queued behind the
//! wedged command and waited the full admission budget (600 s by default)
//! before failing with a scope-less timeout. Production 2026-09-04 (OB3): five
//! console sends, each abandoned after exactly 600 s, while the probe had
//! already paged the stall.
//!
//! This module is the seam between the two. The probe publishes its verdict
//! here; the bridge's admission path reads it and fails fast, typed and naming
//! the open `stall_id`, instead of waiting. It is OBSERVATION, not authority:
//! nothing here mutates the actor, and a `Live` reading is never proof of
//! health (the probe measures whether the loop drains, not whether the mob is
//! healthy).
//!
//! Three states, deliberately not a boolean:
//!
//! - [`ActorLoopHealthState::Live`]: no open stall. Deliveries proceed under
//!   their ordinary admission budget.
//! - [`ActorLoopHealthState::Stalled`]: the probe's round trip is parked
//!   unanswered. Deliveries fail fast until the probe closes this exact
//!   `stall_id`.
//! - [`ActorLoopHealthState::Terminated`]: the parked probe resolved with the
//!   actor's channels CLOSED. The loop did not recover; it is gone. Nothing in
//!   this process can bring it back, so the state is terminal and deliveries
//!   fail fast with a distinct error telling the operator to restart.
