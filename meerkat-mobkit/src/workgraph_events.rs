//! Projection of meerkat's TRANSACTIONAL WorkGraph facts onto MobKit's event
//! and SSE surfaces.
//!
//! # What a fact is, and what it is not
//!
//! `WorkGraphFact` (meerkat 0.8.22, `meerkat-workgraph/src/types.rs`) is
//! recorded by the SAME durable commit as the mutation that first observes it.
//! It is a ledger fact, not a wake instruction, and this module never promotes
//! one into authority:
//!
//! - A projected fact is a **lossy wake accelerant**. It says "something at
//!   this identity may have changed"; it never says what the current state is.
//! - The envelope carries **identifiers only** ([`WorkGraphFactEnvelope`]).
//!   No `WorkItem`, no status, no owner, no claim, no evidence. A consumer
//!   that wants state MUST read it back through the authoritative WorkGraph
//!   read surface (`mobkit/workgraph/get`, `/list`, `/ready`, `/snapshot`).
//! - Delivery is best-effort. [`WorkGraphFactStream`] is a
//!   [`tokio::sync::broadcast`] channel: a slow subscriber is dropped with
//!   `RecvError::Lagged` and this module does **not** backfill. Losing a wake
//!   costs latency, never correctness, precisely because no decision may be
//!   made from the fact alone.
//! - Nothing inside MobKit consumes a projected fact to make a decision. The
//!   projection is emit-only.
//!
//! # Why polling, and why never `list_attention`
//!
//! meerkat-workgraph exposes no subscription seam at 0.8.22 - there is no
//! `subscribe`, `watch`, or `broadcast` anywhere in the crate. The only
//! readable stream is `WorkGraphService::events`, an `after_seq`-cursored,
//! bounded, ascending page over the durable event ledger, so the bridge is a
//! cursor tail ([`poll_workgraph_facts`]).
//!
//! `WorkGraphService::list_attention` is deliberately NOT on this path.
//! Upstream strips the status filter before the store read
//! (`meerkat-workgraph/src/service.rs:364`) and re-applies eligibility-at-now
//! in process (`:378`), so every call reads `MAX_COLLECTION_LIMIT + 1 = 1001`
//! rows (`:368`) and REFUSES outright above 1000 (`:370`) - while superseded
//! and stopped binding rows accumulate permanently. Calling it once per
//! transition is the outage path; this module never calls it.
//!
//! # Cursor semantics
//!
//! [`WorkGraphFactPage::next_after_seq`] is the maximum `seq` of the events
//! this page actually observed. It is safe to resume from ("no visible event
//! is skipped") but it is deliberately NOT advertised as the raw ledger
//! frontier: `list_public_events` omits the internal `ExecutionBound` /
//! `ExecutionTransitioned` kinds, so ledger rows may exist between two
//! consecutive visible sequences.
//!
//! Events that carry no `seq` cannot advance a cursor, and emitting their
//! facts would re-emit the same fact on every poll forever. Both built-in
//! stores stamp `seq` on every read row (`meerkat-workgraph/src/store.rs:1647`
//! for the memory store, `:4583` for SQLite), so a seq-less row means a custom
//! `WorkGraphStore` is not stamping sequences. Such rows are counted into
//! [`WorkGraphFactPage::events_without_seq`] as a defect signal and never
//! emitted.
//!
//! # Subscription activation window
//!
//! Registering an SSE subscriber wakes the idle tail, while the SSE stream
//! independently sends `workgraph.resync_required` with `initial_sync`. The
//! tail then discovers the current durable frontier before it starts live
//! polling. A mutation committed after `initial_sync` is delivered but before
//! that frontier read completes can therefore be included in the starting
//! cursor and produce no fact wake. This loss is intentional and is the same
//! class of loss as broadcast lag: the stream is never a completeness feed.
//! Consumers whose correctness depends on freshness must schedule durable
//! WorkGraph pulls themselves; `initial_sync` and later facts only accelerate
//! those reads.
