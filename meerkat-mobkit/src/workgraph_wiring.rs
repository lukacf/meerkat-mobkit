//! Wire meerkat's WorkGraph (goals, work items, attention bindings and
//! apply-time attention overlays) into the gateways.
//!
//! A mob profile's `tools.workgraph = true` maps (in `meerkat-mob`) to
//! `override_workgraph = Enable`, but a build with the category enabled and
//! no dispatcher in the agent factory's `default_workgraph_tools` slot is a
//! hard build error on non-wasm surfaces. [`attach_workgraph_tools`] fills
//! that slot from a durable SQLite store; [`attach_workgraph_tools_ephemeral`]
//! is the memory-store variant for non-persistent launches. Both return the
//! realm-scoped [`WorkGraphService`] so the same instance can back the
//! `mobkit/workgraph/*` RPC surface, mob-runtime attention overlays
//! (`MobBuilder::with_workgraph_service` via `MobBootstrapSpec`), and the
//! schedule host's apply-time overlay injection.
//!
//! The realm id is the mob definition id — mirroring the schedule host's
//! `owner_id` choice. Meerkat hosts refuse to invent a realm, so callers must
//! always pass a real one.

/// legitimately-delegated agents.
///
/// Round-3 finding R1: `workgraph_attention_reassign` mints an Active
/// binding on the NEW target, so a coordinate-mode member could land a second
/// occupying binding on an occupied member where an ABAC-granted operator on
/// the RPC surface is refused, and could race the RPC guards. Upstream ask 25
/// closes the exact-key Active/Active half of that in the store
/// (`active_target_occupant_tx`), but not the paused, cross-spelling or
/// session-identity-alias cases, and an admitted duplicate is no longer the
/// hard `MultipleActiveBindings` failure it once was - the turn overlay
/// arbitrates newest-binding-wins and silently starves the loser's goal (see
/// [`crate::workgraph_admission`]'s module docs for the full subsumption
/// split). Both dispatch paths therefore intercept the reassign: when the
/// late-bound [`WorkGraphAdmissionSlot`] is filled (by
/// `MobRuntime::bootstrap` — the wrapper is constructed before the mob
/// exists), the call holds the runtime-wide admission across the forward
/// and runs the same occupancy check as the RPC arms; when unfilled
/// (non-mob embedder) it forwards as before.
///
/// Round-4 Q3: the admission is taken only for a reassign that CARRIES the
/// attention-projection witness. Upstream requires the witness on both
/// dispatch entry points — the trait `dispatch` funnels into
/// `dispatch_with_context` with a default (witness-less) context, and a
/// missing projection is an immediate `access_denied` for
/// `workgraph_attention_reassign` before any store access (meerkat 0.8.22,
/// meerkat-workgraph/src/tool_surface.rs; `WorkGraphToolSurface::new` bakes
/// in no projection). A witness-less reassign therefore forwards directly
/// into that cheap upstream denial instead of queueing on the global gate +
/// cross-process sidecar (up to its 30s busy timeout) — otherwise a
/// retry-looping model plus a wedged co-process would stall every operator
/// binding mutation behind calls that can never succeed.
///
/// Round-4 Q2: an admitted reassign whose session target resolves to a
/// roster member is forwarded with the target lowered to the member's owner
/// form — the same normalize-at-write rule as the RPC arms (see
/// [`crate::workgraph_admission`]'s module docs), so tool-plane writes never
/// mint the session-form member rows that are alias-blind cross-process.

/// `ensure_realm_manifest_pin_with_candidates` nor
/// `enforce_fail_closed_durability`. That is the same ruling the schedule,

/// `enforce_fail_closed_durability` judges a PROVIDER-DECLARED
/// [`meerkat_core::DurabilityDeclaration`] - a `DurabilityResolution` the
/// provider asserts and mobkit holds it to. A bare `Arc<dyn WorkGraphStore>`
/// asserts nothing, and mobkit cannot derive the missing assertion:
/// `WorkGraphStore::kind()` is a BACKEND-SHAPE tag, not a durability oracle.
/// `Custom` covers every third-party backend indistinguishably - a durable
/// Postgres and an in-process test double both report it - and `Sqlite` says
/// nothing about the caller-supplied path behind it (a tmpfs or temp-dir file
/// reports `Sqlite` exactly as a durable one does). Gating on `kind()` would
/// therefore refuse legitimate durable backends and admit non-durable ones,
/// which is worse than not gating. So durability rides with the injector, and
/// the storage census must label the slot caller-injected rather than assert
/// a resolution mobkit never established. An embedder that wants the
/// fail-closed rule applied to its workgraph has the seam for it: supply a
/// `MobKitStorageProvider` whose `meerkat_provider()` declares the `workgraph`
/// domain.
///
/// For the same reason `workgraph` must NOT be added to
/// `storage_provider::REQUIRED_MOBKIT_DURABILITY_DOMAINS`:
/// that constant enumerates the MOBKIT-level slots a `MobKitStorageProvider`
/// must declare exactly once, and its completeness check would then refuse
