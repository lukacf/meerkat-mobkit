//! Mob-realm scoping of member-bound WorkGraph attention.
//!
//! meerkat 0.8.41 builds every mob member in the realm `mob.<mob_id>` and
//! rescopes the WorkGraph service a host hands the mob runtime to that realm
//! (`meerkat_mob::mob_scoped_workgraph_service`), so a member resolves its
//! attention bindings in the mob realm and nowhere else. A goal, attention
//! binding or reassignment that names a member (`WorkOwnerKey::mob_agent`,
//! id `mob/<mob_id>/agent/<identity>`) from any other realm is refused typed
//! by meerkat (`WorkGraphError::AttentionTargetRealmMismatch`): storing it
//! elsewhere would put it where the member never looks.
//!
//! MobKit's own runtime service is scoped to the mob realm at construction
//! (`workgraph_wiring::scoped_workgraph_service`), so member-bound work for
//! THIS mob created through the console, the RPC surfaces or the agent tool
//! plane already lands in the realm the member reads. Two things remain and
//! live here:
//!
//! 1. [`classify_goal_target`]: the typed owner-key classification the RPC
//!    arms use to refuse a member of ANOTHER mob before the write. The console
//!    and stdin surfaces are scoped to one realm by contract (`realm_id` is
//!    never accepted over the wire), so a binding written into a sibling mob's
//!    realm from here would be unlistable and unmanageable from this surface;
//!    it is refused with meerkat's own typed error instead of being routed or
//!    silently accepted. Such work is created through that mob's own runtime.
//! 2. [`migrate_member_bindings_to_mob_realms`]: bindings that predate the
//!    rescoping. Before meerkat 0.8.41 an agent-spawned child mob shared the
//!    parent runtime's service unscoped, so a console-created goal that
//!    bound a child-mob member (an explicit `owner` key naming the child)
//!    lived in the parent realm and the child member found it there. After the
//!    rescoping the child resolves attention in `mob.<child>` and that binding
//!    is invisible. The migration re-creates every such binding in the mob
//!    realm its owner key names, over the same store, and cancels the parent
//!    realm original (which stops its binding), so a second run finds nothing
//!    to do. It runs at `MobRuntime` bootstrap ([`WorkGraphRealmMigrationMode`]
//!    on the bootstrap spec) and its report is exposed on `mobkit/capabilities`.
