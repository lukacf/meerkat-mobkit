//! Cross-mob control protocol: the control-plane RPC that crosses
//! processes.
//!
//! * `ControlRequest` / `ControlResponse` - the on-the-wire types.
//! * [`serve_tcp_control`] / [`serve_uds_control`] - accept connections on
//!   a gateway's control listener, read framed requests, dispatch them
//!   against a local mob via a [`ControlHandler`], and write back framed
//!   responses. `UnifiedRuntime::start_control_listener` binds the
//!   listener and spawns the serve task.
//! * [`RemoteControlClient`] - opens a connection per request, sends a
//!   single frame, reads the response. Used by
//!   [`super::cross_mob_remote::RemoteMobProxy`].
//!
//! # Wire shape
//!
//! Each frame is `[u32 BE length][JSON UTF-8 payload]`. JSON is preferred
//! over CBOR for control because it stays human-debuggable in pcap traces
//! and the volume is tiny (one message per `wire`/`unwire`/`inject` call,
//! not per agent turn). `meerkat-comms`'s `TransportCodec` is reserved for
//! agent envelopes.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! Descriptor trust is delegated to the contact directory: when a peer
//! mobkit calls `RemoteMobProxy::wire_remote`, it includes the *peer's*
//! expected `peer_pubkey_b64` in the request. The remote gateway feeds
//! that pubkey into the resulting `TrustedPeerDescriptor`, and
//! `meerkat-comms` rejects envelope traffic that doesn't match it. So the
//! artifacts the control channel produces (peer descriptors) are
//! signature-checked at every subsequent comms ingress regardless of what
//! the control channel itself does.
//!
//! That delegation covers the ENVELOPE plane only. It says nothing about
//! who may drive the control plane itself: an unauthorized
//! [`ControlRequest::Inject`] reaches a member's session without ever
//! minting a descriptor. Two independent authenticities therefore live
//! here:
//!
//! * **Server authenticity** ([`verify_control_response`]) - the serving
//!   gateway signs its responses, and a caller that pins the peer's pubkey
//!   refuses answers it cannot attribute.
//! * **Caller authorization** ([`ControlAuthorizer`]) - the calling
//!   gateway signs its requests with its own keypair, and the serving
//!   gateway matches that identity against a [`ControlGrantTable`] that
//!   binds it to specific verbs and a member scope. Anything outside the
//!   grant is refused before dispatch with a typed
//!   [`ControlAuthzDenial`].
//!
//! Caller authorization is INERT until a grant table is installed:
//! [`ControlAuthorizer::open`] (the default a plain
//! `UnifiedRuntime::start_control_listener` uses) authorizes nothing, so
//! deployments that have not configured grants behave exactly as before.
//! Callers stamp their signature unconditionally, which is why the field
//! is additive per variant rather than a wrapper frame - see
//! [`ControlCaller`].
