//! Cross-mob remote-mob proxy: the client side of cross-process cross-mob
//! operations.
//!
//! `cross_mob.rs` dispatches wire/unwire/send operations as
//! `LocalOrRemote`: same-process peers registered via `register_peer_mob`
//! use their `MobHandle` directly; peers whose contact-directory entry
//! names a `tcp://host:port` or `uds:///path` transport are reached through
//! [`RemoteMobProxy`], which speaks the control protocol defined in
//! [`super::cross_mob_control`] (length-prefixed JSON frames, one
//! request/response pair per connection).
//!
//! [`RemoteMobProxy`] carries four operations against the peer gateway's
//! control listener:
//!
//! * [`RemoteMobProxy::wire_remote`] / [`RemoteMobProxy::unwire_remote`]
//!   install or remove a `TrustedPeerDescriptor` for one of OUR members on
//!   a member of the remote mob.
//! * [`RemoteMobProxy::inject_message`] performs an app-level external-turn
//!   injection into a remote member's session (`send_cross_mob`).
//! * [`RemoteMobProxy::lookup_member`] discovers a remote member's comms
//!   facts (peer id, comms name, transport pubkey, advertised address) so
//!   the local side can build a signed descriptor without caller-supplied
//!   bookkeeping.
//!
//! The server side is [`super::cross_mob_control::MobHandleControlHandler`],
//! bound by `UnifiedRuntime::start_control_listener` (builder
//! `control_listen()` or the gateway `--control-listen` flag). Each request
//! opens a fresh connection; control RPC frequency is low (one message per
//! wire/unwire/inject call), so connection pooling is deliberately not
//! implemented.
