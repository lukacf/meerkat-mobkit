//! Remote runtime-host lifecycle: endpoint identity, capability
//! discovery, health, durable pairing, and reconnect for MobKit gateways
//! that other gateways treat as PLACEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE.
//!
//! # What a runtime host is here, and what it is not
//!
//! A runtime host is a process that can *run* work. It is never a mob
//! authority and never a project authority. Nothing in this module lets a
//! host mutate a controller's mob, roster, topology, or project state:
//! the only two operations that cross the wire
//! ([`super::cross_mob_control::ControlVerb::HostDescribe`] and
//! [`super::cross_mob_control::ControlVerb::HostHealth`]) are read-only
//! projections the host makes *about itself*, and the only durable
//! artifact ([`HostPairingRecord`]) lives on the CONTROLLER and is never
//! read or written by the host.
//!
//! That asymmetry is structural, not a convention:
//!
//! * The host serves facts and stores nothing about who asked.
//! * The controller stores the pairing and pins the host identity.
//! * A [`HostPairingRecord`] can therefore never become an authority the
//!   host can edit, because the host has no verb that writes one.
//!
//! # Placement is surveyed, not decided
//!
//! [`HostFacts::placement_labels`] carries the host's self-reported
//! labels through as an opaque projection (the same shape
//! `meerkat_contracts::RuntimeHostInfo::placement_labels` uses). This
//! module deliberately implements NO candidate selection, scoring, or
//! assignment. Placement authority for multi-host mobs already exists on
//! the meerkat side and is not MobKit's to duplicate:
//! `meerkat_mob::store::MobHostAuthorityRecord` with its typed
//! write/delete permits, and the `RemoteHostBind*` / `RemoteHostRevoke*`
//! event family in `meerkat_mob::event::MobEventKind`. A MobKit-side
//! chooser would either shadow that authority or compete with it.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! A host is identified by the Ed25519 public key its gateway signs
//! control responses with - the same key a
//! [`crate::contact_directory::ContactEntry`] pins - and by nothing else.
//! Self-reported strings (`host_label`, `advertised_control_address`) are
//! carried for display and are never trusted:
//!
//! * `meerkat_contracts::RuntimeHostInfo::host_id` is surface-minted and,
//!   under `RuntimeHostIdScope::Process`, is explicitly only stable for
//!   one process lifetime - useless as a durable pairing key.
//! * `meerkat_mob::store::MobHostAuthorityRecord::host_id` is a comms
//!   `PeerId`, a third vocabulary again.
//!
//! Keying the pairing on the signing key is what makes the pin
//! meaningful: it is the one field the control channel actually
//! authenticates.
//!
//! # Verification status
//!
//! Everything here is exercised across a PROCESS boundary at best (see
//! `tests/cross_mob_two_process.rs` for the existing idiom). No test in
//! this repository crosses a real HOST boundary, so health and reconnect
//! behaviour under genuine network partition is unverified.
