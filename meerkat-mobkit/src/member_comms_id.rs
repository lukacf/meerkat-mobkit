//! Single owner of the mapping between MobKit's public member aliases and
//! the mob-roster member ids handed to meerkat-mob.
//!
//! Meerkat 0.7 made the mob member comms name a fail-closed typed owner
//! (`meerkat_core::connection::MemberCommsName`): every component — including
//! the member id — must start with an ASCII letter or `_` and contain only
//! ASCII alphanumerics, `-`, or `_`. MobKit's identity-first surface mints
//! runtime-id-shaped member identities (`rt:{identity}:{generation}`, where
//! the durable identity itself conventionally contains `:`, e.g.
//! `review:singleton`), which 0.6.34 accepted (the comms name was an
//! unvalidated `format!`) and 0.7 rejects at spawn.
//!
//! The public alias space is unchanged: consoles, RPC surfaces, SDKs, and
//! persisted continuity records keep speaking `rt:review:singleton:0`. This
//! module encodes those aliases into comms-safe roster ids at the
//! mobkit→meerkat-mob boundary and decodes roster ids back to public aliases
//! at projection boundaries.
//!
//! Encoding contract:
//! - An alias that is already a valid comms-name component (and does not
//!   start with the reserved `mk--` marker) maps to itself, so plain
//!   definition-mob member names are untouched.
//! - Anything else maps to `mk--` + escaped body, where `_` → `__`,
//!   `:` → `_c`, and any other non-`[A-Za-z0-9-]` char → `_x{hex}_`.
//! - `decode(encode(s)) == s` for every alias, and `decode` is the identity
//!   on ids that were never encoded. The `mk--` prefix is a reserved
//!   namespace: user-chosen member names must not start with it (encode
//!   re-encodes such names so the round-trip still holds).
//!
//! This is a **public stability surface**: consumers that talk to raw
//! `MobHandle` APIs (which speak the encoded roster-id space on meerkat 0.7+)
//! must encode aliases on the way in and decode roster ids on the way out
//! using exactly this codec — there is no separate "correct" encoding. Use
//! [`mob_member_id`]/[`mob_member_id_str`] at the mobkit→meerkat-mob boundary
//! and [`runtime_alias_str`]/[`runtime_event_alias`] at projection boundaries.
