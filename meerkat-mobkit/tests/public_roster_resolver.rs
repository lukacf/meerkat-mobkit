//! Reachability of the roster resolvers from OUTSIDE the crate.
//!
//! An integration test is a separate crate, so a `pub(crate)` function does not
//! compile here. That is the entire point of this file: the inline module tests
//! call these same functions happily whether they are `pub` or `pub(crate)`, so
//! they prove nothing about what an embedder can reach.
//!
//! That gap shipped. `roster_member_id_for_identity` was `pub(crate)` while
//! being the only correct way for an embedder to produce a roster key, and an
//! instruction to call it produced E0603 for OB3 rather than a working fix - an
//! instruction that was correct and premature, which is harder to diagnose than
//! one that is simply wrong, because the compiler error has three plausible
//! causes and no way to rank them.
//!
//! If either resolver stops being public, this file fails to COMPILE. A test
//! that has to run in order to notice would already be too late.
