//! Normalized provider token accounting for MobKit's LLM test doubles.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! meerkat 0.8.22 split provider usage into typed per-turn and cumulative
//! carriers. `Agent::commit_calling_llm_response` now runs
//! `TurnUsage::try_from_usage(result.usage)` and fails the turn closed with
//! `normalized_provider_accounting_unavailable` when the stream carried no
//! `LlmEvent::UsageUpdate`, then runs `validate_provider_turn_usage_identity`
//! and fails closed with `normalized_provider_accounting_identity_mismatch`
//! when the accounting's `(provider, model)` is not the ACTIVE session
//! identity. The CHANGELOG states it plainly: "Custom adapters must emit
//! matching provider/model accounting or the turn fails closed."
//!
//! `LlmStreamResult::new` still accepts a flat `Usage`, and `LlmEvent::Done`
//! is still constructible on its own, so a test double that omits usage
//! COMPILES CLEANLY and then fails on every single agent turn it drives. That
//! is exactly the defect meerkat hit in its own fixtures, and it recurred here
//! at scale.
//!
//! # The contract this file exists to make unbreakable
//!
//! Do not hand-roll `LlmEvent::Done` in a MobKit test double. Call
//! [`usage_then_done`] (or [`usage_then_done_with`]) and yield BOTH returned
//! events. The helper cannot produce a `Done` without the `UsageUpdate` that
//! precedes it, so a double built through it cannot regress the way 28 of
//! MobKit's doubles regressed at once. A helper that cannot emit `Done`
//! without usage is a contract; 28 correct copies is a convention, and the
//! 29th copy breaks it.
//!
//! # Why the provider is derived from the model and not from `provider()`
//!
//! `LlmClient::provider()` is NOT the identity the check compares against.
//! MobKit installs the mob-wide default client through
//! `ProviderAgnosticLlmClient`, which reports `Provider::Other` precisely so
//! one stub can serve members across providers
//! (`src/mob_handle_runtime.rs`). `AgentFactory` therefore skips its
//! raw-override provider guard (`Other` is meerkat's typed "serves any
//! provider" claim) and binds `LlmClientAdapter` to the CANONICAL provider
//! resolved from the model. A double that hardcoded `Provider::OpenAI` while
//! running on a `claude-*` profile would bind fine and then fail the identity
//! check at commit time.
//!
//! So the canonical answer comes from the same authority the factory used:
//! `meerkat_models::infer_provider(&request.model)`. `client_declared` is only
//! the fallback for UNCATALOGUED models, where `AgentFactory`'s own last
//! resort is likewise `llm_client_override.provider()`
//! (`meerkat/src/factory.rs`, `resolve_provider_from_registry`).
//!
//! Included from both integration tests (`#[path = "support/llm_usage.rs"]`)
//! and the crate's own `#[cfg(test)]` doubles (via
//! `src/mob_handle_runtime.rs`), so there is exactly ONE definition of this
//! contract in the repo.
//!
//! # The same rule for meerkat's own `TestClient`
//!
//! MobKit's hand-written doubles are not the only offenders.
//! `meerkat_client::TestClient::default()` DOES backfill a missing
//! `UsageUpdate` (`synthesize_usage`), but it declares
//! `Provider::Other` - so it clears `normalized_provider_accounting_unavailable`
//! and then trips `normalized_provider_accounting_identity_mismatch` the
//! moment the profile model is CATALOGUED. Every MobKit profile is
//! `model = "gpt-5.5"`, whose canonical owner is `Provider::OpenAI`, so the
//! adapter is bound to `OpenAI` while the synthesized accounting says
//! `Other`. That is why meerkat 0.8.22 added
//! `TestClient::for_provider(provider)` and why its own turn-driving fixtures
//! (`meerkat-mob/tests/support/mod.rs`) use it.
//!
//! Rule for MobKit: a `TestClient` installed as `default_llm_client` (or any
//! other turn-driving seam) must be `TestClient::for_provider(P)` where `P`
//! is the CANONICAL owner of the profile's model - `Provider::OpenAI` for
//! `gpt-5.5`. Keep `TestClient::default()` ONLY where the profile model is
//! UNCATALOGUED with no `[models.<id>]` entry, because there the canonical
//! provider itself resolves to `Other` and `default()` is the matching claim.
//! `TestClient::new(events)` leaves `synthesize_usage` OFF entirely: those
//! call sites must carry an explicit `UsageUpdate` built from [`turn_usage`].
