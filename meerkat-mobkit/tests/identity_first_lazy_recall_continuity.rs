//! LazyMaterialize cross-boot recall guard (OB3 field report, 2026-07-29:
//! "silent resume context loss").
//!
//! # The coverage hole this closes
//!
//! Two deterministic guards cover the EAGER bootstrap arm
//! (`identity_first_cold_restart_continuity`,
//! `identity_first_respawn_continuity`) and both are green. Nothing paired the
//! LAZY arm with a recall assertion, and the two arms diverge in
//! `IdentityFirstRuntimeContext::apply_roster_controlled`:
//! `EagerMaterialize` runs `orchestrator::restore_flow` (resume at bootstrap),
//! while `LazyMaterialize | LazyWithBackgroundWarm` run
//! `orchestrator::lazy_register_flow`, which registers every identity as
//! Dormant with its `ContinuityRecord` attached and materializes NOTHING.
//! Materialization is deferred to the first `send`/`dispatch`, which gates on
//! `Dormant | Uninitialized` and calls the shared `embody_identity` door.
//!
//! The field report: boot A takes a turn and the post-turn document lands in
//! the store with correctly-ordered messages; after a kill -9 and boot B every
//! resume signature is clean (0 conflicts, 0 held, 0 quarantined, 0 Broken),
//! yet the agent answers the next message with no record of the earlier
//! exchange. The store is right and the model's working context was empty —
//! completely silent, nothing in logs. So the property to pin is not a status
//! or a store row: it is the BYTES OF THE POST-RESTART LLM REQUEST.
//!
//! # Harness shape (and the trap it avoids)
//!
//! Same trap as `identity_first_head_canonical_resume`: plain
//! `persistent_state()` + `roster_provider()` gives sessions a
//! `SqliteSessionStore` and uses continuity for identity metadata only, which
//! exercises neither the continuity adapter nor the resume read path the
//! deployment runs. `continuity_from_state_dir` installs the substrate as BOTH
//! the identity authority and (via `ContinuitySessionStoreAdapter`) meerkat's
//! `SessionStore` — the gateway/OB3 topology. Every boot therefore probes
//! `assert_durable_continuity_document` before asserting behavior, so a
//! mis-wired harness fails as MIS-WIRED instead of passing while proving
//! nothing.
//!
//! Scope note: OB3's store is a BigQuery WHOLE-BLOB store behind that same
//! adapter; this runs the local `LocalContinuityStore` behind it. What is held
//! constant with the field deployment is the bootstrap mode and the adapter
//! seam, not the remote store implementation.

///   `checkpoint.rs`) tells the operator recovery needs attention. Two of the

/// - RECALL is fine: the send is accepted and replays the pre-crash
///   transcript.
/// - SILENT AMNESIA is not: an accepted turn whose request carries none of the
///   prior transcript, which then saves cleanly over the durable head. That is
///   the shape the deployment observed mid-cycle, and the store looks perfect
///   afterwards precisely because the save re-merges — so only the request
///   bytes can tell the two apart.
// The fixture cannot yet be armed, and the reason is a finding in itself.
//
// MEASURED: with the turn stalled inside the LLM call — and stalled AFTER a
// completed `peers` tool round trip, so the turn had in-flight work behind it
// — the continuity file did not move for 20s: head 3 messages, 3 strand rows,
// 0 rewrite commits, i.e. exactly the pre-turn boundary. On this substrate
// NOTHING between a turn's admission and its boundary save is durable: not the
// user message, not the assistant tool-call message, not the tool result. A
// mid-turn kill is therefore byte-identical to a pre-turn kill, so a resume
// after one reads an intact committed boundary and this axis cannot be
// asserted honestly (the barrier fails loudly rather than certify that).
//
// WHERE THE FIELD'S SHAPE MUST COME FROM INSTEAD: the intra-turn projection
// stamp ("the only durable checkpoint is an intra-turn projection", forbidden
// as an authority base by `checkpoint.rs`) is minted in exactly one place —
// `meerkat-session/src/persistent.rs:1899` and `:1932`, the head bridging
// inside a transcript-REWRITE sequence. So the field state implicates a crash
// during a COMPACTION rewrite, not a crash during an ordinary turn. Arming
// this axis needs a kill inside that multi-step rewrite persist (or a
// whole-blob substrate that checkpoints mid-turn), which the in-process LLM
// seam cannot reach; the subprocess harness
// (identity_first_subprocess_reboot.rs) can land a real kill -9 mid-persist.
// Un-ignore once armed; the loud-or-recalls assertion is ready.

/// fleet's max-depth 26-rewrite chain, 57-message head, 191 strand rows).
///
/// The class-3 shape, preserved from their cross-team note: a released HEAD
/// ROW EXISTS (created by a later delta write) while the compact
/// graph/rewrite-prefix strata do not - so adoption must key on the
/// RELEASED HEAD's inability to authorize a mutation, never on
/// head-absence. Before the adoption lane, the first projected boundary at
/// boot refused fleet-wide: "rewrite rejected: rewritten current head has
/// no compact graph-prefix authority" (17/17 identities degraded pending
/// retry; the fail-closed side held).
///
/// BYTE-LOSSLESS PRINCIPLE (lead ruling): the bundle is reconstituted
/// verbatim - every row of every table, through the bundle's own DDL - and
/// the HARNESS adopts the bundle's identity space instead (mob `homecore`,
/// profile `domain`, member `domain:calendar`), so the persisted
/// `mob_member_binding` and `comms_name` match the booting mob without a
/// single byte of document surgery. The first execution of the patched-
/// metadata variant of this leg proved why: the identity-binding guard
/// refuses a foreign-deployment document BEFORE adoption is reached.
///
/// This leg boots that composition over the reconstitution with NO runtime
/// store: the mint reads through the head-lane importer, resume spawns, the
/// boundary projection ADOPTS under the import receipt, the identity is
/// ACTIVE, the fleet transcript replays, and a real turn extends the
/// adopted (current-format) head durably.
