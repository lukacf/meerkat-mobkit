//! Regression: a graceful gateway exit must RELEASE the schedule executor
//! lease, in BOTH gateway binaries.
//!
//! Both binaries bound `_schedule_host` and relied on `Drop`. Dropping a
//! `ScheduleHostHandle` only SIGNALS the supervisor; only
//! `ScheduleHostHandle::shutdown().await` calls
//! `driver.release_executor_lease()`, and tokio gives no guarantee the woken
//! supervisor is polled between main's completion and runtime teardown. The
//! lease row was measured still held (owner_id, lease_token, acquired_at_ms and
//! expires_at_ms all set) 57s past a clean exit on a production store.
//!
//! Cost: the replacement process gets
//! `AcquireScheduleExecutorLeaseOutcome::Busy`, its tick returns without
//! claiming due occurrences, and schedules do not fire for up to the 60s lease
//! duration after every restart. The claim watchdog cannot see it - its overdue
//! threshold is longer than the window.
//!
//! Both binaries are covered on purpose. `rpc_gateway` is the one with a live
//! consumer, and the two differ in store layout, init params and composition
//! order, so a fix verified on one proves nothing about the other. The first
//! draft of this test exercised `mobkit_gateway` alone.
//!
//! Nothing in the type system enforces the call: the previous code compiled
//! clean and warned nothing. This test observes the SQLite row, which is the
//! only place the defect was ever visible.
//!
//! WHAT EACH LEG IS AND IS NOT PROVEN TO CATCH. Reverting the fix in both
//! binaries and re-running:
//!
//!     rpc_gateway       FAILS, on the exact assertion, first try
//!     mobkit_gateway    PASSES, 7 runs out of 7
//!
//! So only the `rpc_gateway` leg is a mutation-proven guard for this defect.
//! Under `mobkit_gateway`'s teardown the signalled supervisor evidently does
//! get polled in time, and `Drop` releases the lease anyway - which is luck
//! this harness cannot take away, not a property the code states. The
//! `mobkit_gateway` leg is kept because the assertion is true and cheap and
//! would still catch a hard regression (a lease never released at all), but it
//! must not be read as evidence that the `shutdown().await` call is what makes
//! that binary correct. Do not delete the `rpc_gateway` leg on the theory that
//! the two are redundant. They are not.
