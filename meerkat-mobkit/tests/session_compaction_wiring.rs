//! Session-compaction wiring on MobKit's built session path.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! A production MobKit deployment sent 616_000 input tokens to produce a
//! five-token reply, with turn latency scaling from 3.4s at 13 messages to
//! 400s at 466 messages. The reported diagnosis was "no compactor is
//! installed anywhere in mobkit's session-build path".
//!
//! That diagnosis is wrong, and nothing in the repo could prove it either
//! way — hence this file. Meerkat's `AgentFactory::build_agent` always
//! installs a `meerkat_session::DefaultCompactor` (the `session-compaction`
//! feature is unified on through `meerkat-mob`'s dependency declaration), and
//! MobKit routes every session build through it. The real defect is the
//! *trigger*: with no host policy, meerkat replaces its documented `100_000`
//! default with `context_window * 4 / 5`, which on a million-token model is
//! `840_000` tokens — so 616_000 legitimately sails through.
//!
//! These tests pin both halves:
//!
//! * `built_member_session_path_carries_a_compactor` fails if the compactor
//!   ever stops being installed (feature drift, or a MobKit path that stops
//!   routing through `AgentFactory`).
//! * `inherited_policy_lets_a_200k_token_turn_through` pins the inherited
//!   model-aware trigger that made the knob look dead.
//! * `host_compaction_policy_pins_the_trigger` proves
//!   `UnifiedRuntimeBuilder::compaction()` reaches the compactor the member's
//!   session is actually built with.
