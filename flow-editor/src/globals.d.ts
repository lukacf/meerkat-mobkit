// and the data.js boot global.
//
// Migration-window typing (removed by the strictness ratchet): the ambients
// are any-typed and tsconfig sets "types": [] so this program checks
// identifier resolution and module linkage — the load-bearing guard, since
// esbuild silently treats unresolved identifiers as globals — without
// retro-typing the verbatim-moved view components the shell imports. This is
// the same looseness the package programs have, where "react" deliberately
// does not resolve.
