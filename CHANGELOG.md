# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Per-mob steward dreams (§8.5): with `agent_memory.steward.per_mob = true` on
  a multi-mob host, each dream attempt runs one partition per mob — that mob's
  scope plus its members' identity scopes, consolidated against that mob's own
  purpose/roster context — plus a realm-remainder partition owning
  operator/realm scopes, unrostered identities, and promotion/operator review.
  Each partition run takes its own runs-per-day budget slot. With 0–1 mobs the
  whole-realm dream is used unchanged (the flag was previously parsed but
  inert).

### Fixed

- Delivery repair no longer rotates a wedged member onto a fresh, empty
  session. The identity bridge's deliver-time repair used to blind-respawn
  (`MobHandle::respawn` = retire + fresh spawn), abandoning the durable
  transcript and rotating the bridge session out from under the durable alias
  (the OB3 `identity_alias_respawn_rotation` report). Repair now rebuilds the
  member ONTO its recorded durable session (`MemberLaunchMode::Resume`) —
  transcript preserved, no session rotation; the fresh respawn survives only
  as the fallback for meerkat's explicit "durable session snapshot is gone"
  answer, and every other resume failure fails the delivery loudly instead of
  destroying state.

## [0.7.22] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Upgraded the meerkat family 0.7.14 → 0.7.15. Carries the upstream
  transcript-restart-loss guard fix: on resume, a byte-identical re-sent base
  prompt is preserved untouched and a changed prompt becomes an audited
  transcript rewrite — both survive, composing with this release's
  Inherit-on-resume default.

### Fixed

- **A rejected resume no longer destroys the conversation.** The identity-first
  session bridge used to catch *any* resume error and fall back to a fresh,
  empty member spawn — permanently abandoning the durable transcript (the
  HomeCore restart-loss bug). A resume failure now keeps the identity → session
  binding intact, marks the identity **Broken** with the real error attached,
  and the next reconcile retries the resume. A roster collision (in-process
  restart) retires the stale member and retries the *resume*, never a fresh
  spawn.
- Reconcile outcome reporting is honest: a bridge resume that fresh-spawned
  reports `created` (never `resumed`), and a successful resume without a
  checkpoint snapshot reports `resumed` (the persisted mob session carried the
  history). Resume errors are classified from meerkat's typed errors
  (`MemberRestoreFailed`, transcript-continuity violations) instead of being
  bucketed into one `runtime_identity_incompatible` reason.
- Resume inherits the persisted System message instead of re-sending the
  spec's explicit prompt. Re-sending made meerkat re-assemble the prompt,
  which trips the session store's transcript-continuity guard on meerkat
  ≤0.7.14 whenever the persisted prompt carries runtime context appends —
  the cold-restart transcript-loss class. Dynamic per-boot context belongs in
  runtime system-context appends, not the base prompt.

### Added

- The cold-restart continuity regression now runs in CI (previously an
  ignored scaffold): boot → turn → full restart against the same on-disk
  store → assert the identity resumes onto the same session id with the
  transcript replayed, twice (second-restart variant). Its earlier "harness"
  failure was in fact the outcome-reporting lie this release fixes.

## [0.7.21] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Upgraded the meerkat family 0.7.13 → 0.7.14. No API breaks.

### Fixed

- Carried schedule stores authored before 0.7.20 (which hold `schedule_json`
  as TEXT) now read after upgrade instead of failing every read with
  `Invalid column type Text at index: 0, name: schedule_json` — meerkat 0.7.14
  reads schedule JSON columns through a `Text`/`Blob`-tolerant boundary
  (upstream ask A). This unblocks the identity-target schedule repair and the
  steward-dream find-or-create on upgraded deployments.
- A full process restart against a carried on-disk store now resumes each
  agent's transcript instead of falling back to an empty fresh spawn. meerkat
  0.7.14's append-only continuity guard compares the shared transcript prefix
  by content address, tolerating the bookkeeping-only divergence (re-stamped
  run identity + timestamps) a re-created runtime authority produces on cold
  restart (upstream ask B).

### Added

- **P3-outbound (upstream ask 5, outbound half):** a member whose session
  ingests untrusted content now stamps its own signed content-taint on outbound
  peer envelopes (`declare_member_outbound_taint`), cleared on a clean session
  rotation or reset. Receivers read the sender's declaration instead of
  reconstructing taint from host-side joins, propagating taint cross-process.
- **P5 (upstream ask 7):** the memory steward's dream now runs as a durable,
  misfire-aware host-runnable schedule occurrence (idempotent find-or-create
  against the persistent schedule store) instead of a bare in-process interval
  loop; the loop is kept only as the fallback on gateways with no schedule host.
- Upgrade-carry regression tests crossing a store-version boundary
  (`schedule_store_text_carry`; `identity_first_cold_restart_continuity` as an
  ignored scaffold).

## [0.7.20] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Identity-first agent memory injection for Rust, JSON-RPC, Python, and
  TypeScript users, including bundled markdown persistence, contextual recall,
  explicit remember/recall/forget APIs, and next-turn injection for live
  identity sends.
- Classic (roster-less) agent memory: the recorder `memory` tool and build-time
  recall injection now attach to any mob member keyed on its `AgentIdentity`,
  without requiring the roster/IdentityRuntime layer.
- Ambient per-turn memory recall is delivered as a typed injected-context
  message (excluded from compaction indexing) rather than fused into the user's
  text, and is now **on by default** on the identity-first path — echo-safe by
  construction (meerkat 0.7.12 upstream ask 1).
- Compaction-discard harvest reads the exact session-memory range via
  `enumerate_scoped`, and permanently-orphaned session scopes are reclaimed via
  `drop_scope` at the identity-delete seam (asks 2 + 8).
- Distilled memory records pin the transcript head revision their evidence was
  read at, and Hygienist rewrites compare-and-swap on it (ask 4 refinement).
- The taint tracker consumes the typed `AgentEvent::PeerContentIngested`
  sender-taint declaration (canonical peer id, synchronous at ingestion),
  superseding the projection-text join for declared taint (ask 5, inbound).

### Changed

- Upgraded the meerkat dependency family to 0.7.13.

### Fixed

- Host `SessionHook`/customizers that install `external_tools` or
  `additional_instructions` on the session build now compose over the
  agent-memory recorder instead of overwriting it — a plain assignment silently
  dropped the `memory` tool and the build-time recall injection (fixed in the
  incident-command-center example; the recorder is unaffected on paths that
  compose).

## [0.6.39] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Identity-first console records now expose the durable `agent_identity` label
  as the UI/send identity while preserving the runtime member id for bridge
  operations.
- Identity-first external-authoritative runtimes now resume from the supplied
  `ContinuitySessionStoreAdapter` after process restart instead of looking only
  at the process-local runtime snapshot store.
- Console live snapshots no longer read each member's session while building
  `/console/experience`, `/console/modules`, or console member JSON. Snapshot
  model capabilities now come from the mob roster profile, so busy in-flight
  agent turns cannot block the admin console.
- The bundled console's JSON fetch timeout now defaults to 60s and reports an
  explicit timeout reason when aborted. `ConsolePolicy.fetch_timeout_ms` can
  project a custom fetch ceiling to the frontend.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **PreBuildHook** — `persistent_with_hook()` / `ephemeral_with_hook()` accept a `PreBuildHook` closure that mutates `CreateSessionRequest` at `create_session` time, before the session service captures labels and LLM identity. Use for per-agent external tools, system prompt augmentation, label injection, and model overrides.
- `PreBuildMobSessionService` — wraps any `MobSessionService`, intercepting only `create_session`. Implemented via `delegate_mob_session_service!` macro for maintainability.
- `PreBuildHook` type alias exported from crate root
- 3 new tests: `persistent_with_hook_wraps_session_service`, `ephemeral_with_hook_creates_spec`, `pre_build_hook_mutates_create_session_request`

### Fixed

- **Session checkpointing disabled in v0.5.1** — `persistent()` passed `Some(InMemoryRuntimeStore)` to `PersistentSessionService`, which disabled the `StoreCheckpointer` (`enabled: self.runtime_store.is_none()`). Session data was never persisted after turns. Fixed by keeping `runtime_store = None` on the session service and supplying the adapter directly via `MobBootstrapSpec.runtime_adapter`.
- **Stop/resume state recovery** — `RuntimeSessionAdapter::ephemeral()` has no state recovery. Replaced with `RuntimeSessionAdapter::persistent(InMemoryRuntimeStore, blob_store)` on the spec, giving the mob actor a `PersistentRuntimeDriver` that recovers queued runtime inputs across stop/resume within the process lifetime.
- `MobBootstrapSpec` now carries `runtime_adapter: Option<Arc<RuntimeSessionAdapter>>`, wired into `MobBuilder::with_runtime_adapter()` before `with_session_service()` at bootstrap time.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **Comms drain never spawned** — `MobBootstrapSpec::persistent()` and the gateway binary both passed `None` for `runtime_store`, causing `PersistentSessionService::runtime_adapter()` to return `None`. The mob actor's comms drain was never spawned, so AutonomousHost agents exited after their kickoff turn and could not receive subsequent messages. Fixed by supplying an `InMemoryRuntimeStore`.
- Added `meerkat-runtime` as a direct dependency
- Added regression test `persistent_bootstrap_provides_runtime_store`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Cross-mob communication** — contact directory (TOML), `wire_cross_mob`/`unwire_cross_mob`/`send_cross_mob` via `PeerTarget::External`, `peer_info` + `wire_local`/`unwire_local` for SDK-level peering, `::` separator addressing
- **Console RPC** — `POST /console/rpc` JSON-RPC endpoint with full auth gating, capabilities, event log queries, cross-mob peer_info/directory/wire_local/unwire_local
- **10 new 0.5 API methods** — `member_status`, `force_cancel_member`, `spawn_helper`, `fork_helper`, `attach_existing_session`, `cancel_flow`, `flow_status`, `collect_completed`, `member_current_session_id`, `member_session_ref`
- **Console frontend** — conversation transcript with SSE streaming (session-ID correlated), history replay from event log, optimistic entries with rollback
- **Python SDK** — all new RPC methods on `MobHandle`, `wire_cross_mob`/`send_cross_mob`/`peer_info`/`wire_local`/`unwire_local`, `wait_one`/`wait_all` polling, new types (`RichMemberSnapshot`, `HelperResult`, `MemberSessionRef`, `CrossMobContactEntry`)
- **Build isolation** — `scripts/repo-cargo` wrapper isolating `CARGO_HOME`/`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per repo/worktree, `shasum`/`sha256sum` cross-platform fallback
- Contact directory loaded from `config/contacts.toml` via `ConventionalPaths` in gateway startup
- `EventLogStore` exposed via `event_log_store()` for console RPC event queries
- `parse_helper_options` shared as `pub(crate)` between main RPC and console RPC
- 176-line `test_rpc_method_names.py` covering all new SDK methods

### Changed

- **Meerkat 0.5.0 migration** — all deps bumped to 0.5.0, `MemberHandle.send()` replaces `send_message()`, `PeerTarget::External` for cross-mob wiring, subagents folded into builtins
- `MobBootstrapSpec::ephemeral`/`persistent` now enable `builtins`/`shell`/`memory` (matching gateway factories)
- `console_json_router_with_runtime` accepts `contact_directory` and `event_log` params
- Cross-mob wire/unwire/send capabilities gated on `has_inproc_contacts() && has_peer_mob_handles()`
- `rpc::mob_methods` module visibility changed to `pub(crate)`
- Gateway binary renamed from `phase0b_rpc_gateway` to `mobkit_gateway`
- Console frontend embedded bundle must be rebuilt and synced after source changes

### Fixed

- `wire_cross_mob` rolls back local side if remote wire fails
- Console RPC 401/404 exits use proper JSON-RPC format (not bare `{"error": ...}`)
- Console `mobkit/capabilities` correctly reports `is_authenticated = true` after auth gate
- Console `mobkit/status` returns `loaded_modules: []` (not member IDs)
- Console `ensure_member` rejects malformed `resume_session_id` and `additional_instructions`
- `sendInteraction` opens SSE stream before send to avoid missing fast completions
- Stream failure after successful send no longer rolls back the user message
- History query filters out agent-kind events (no payload in `UnifiedEvent::Agent`)
- History visit-level cache prevents transcript duplication on agent re-selection

## [0.4.13] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Full multimodal `send_message` — `ContentInput` (text + images) flows end-to-end through the mob pipeline to the agent session
- `mobkit/send_message` RPC accepts `"content"` field with multimodal blocks alongside existing `"message"` string
- Python SDK `MobHandle.send(content=[...])` for multimodal delivery
- `mobkit/models/catalog` enriched with per-model `profile` including `vision` and `image_tool_results` capability flags
- Python SDK `CatalogEntry` gains `vision` and `image_tool_results` fields
- `MobBootstrapSpec::persistent()` convenience constructor for `PersistentSessionService` with session store forwarding
- `MobBootstrapSpec::ephemeral()` convenience constructor with optional `AgentSessionStore` override

### Changed

- Bump all meerkat crate dependencies to 0.4.13
- MCP `call_tool` adapted for `Vec<ContentBlock>` return type (with lossy-serialization warning for non-text blocks)
- `ToolResult.content` updated from `String` to `Vec<ContentBlock>`
- `RealMobRuntime::send_message` and `UnifiedRuntime::send_message` now accept `impl Into<ContentInput>`

### Fixed

- `FactoryAgentBuilder` session store forwarding — custom stores (e.g. BigQuery) are now passed through to `AgentFactory`, eliminating unnecessary JSONL fallback, redb lock contention, and duplicate persistence

## [0.4.11] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Bump all meerkat crate dependencies to 0.4.11
- Map `SessionError::Unsupported` to HTTP 422 in SSE and interaction endpoints
- `/interactions/stream` is now observe-only (message sending stays in `mobkit/send_message` RPC)
- `NotExternallyAddressable` errors return 403 instead of 500
- Renamed all `phase*` files to semantic names (34 files: binaries, tests, docs)
- `validate_phase0_governance_contracts` deprecated in favor of `validate_governance_contracts`

### Added

- `mobkit/models/catalog` RPC method in both standard and unified dispatchers
- Python SDK: `CatalogEntry`, `ProviderDefaults`, `ModelsCatalogResult` types
- Python SDK: `models_catalog()` on sync/async typed clients and `MobHandle`
- `InteractionComplete`/`InteractionFailed` as terminal SSE events
- Console live snapshot derives `loaded_modules` from discovered agents

### Fixed

- Console live snapshot `loaded_modules` was hard-coded to empty
- `phase_g` test: corrected `repo_root()` path, `.js` → `.cjs` refs, NVM PATH resolution
