## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.13] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Full multimodal `send_message` — `ContentInput` (text + images) flows end-to-end through the mob pipeline to the agent session
- `mobkit/send_message` RPC accepts `"content"` field with multimodal blocks alongside existing `"message"` string
- Python SDK `MobHandle.send(content=[...])` for multimodal delivery
- `mobkit/models/catalog` enriched with per-model `profile` including `vision` and `image_tool_results` capability flags
- Python SDK `CatalogEntry` gains `vision` and `image_tool_results` fields
- `MobBootstrapSpec::persistent()` convenience constructor for `PersistentSessionService` with session store forwarding
- `MobBootstrapSpec::ephemeral()` convenience constructor with optional `AgentSessionStore` override

### Changed

- Bump all meerkat crate dependencies to 0.4.13
- MCP `call_tool` adapted for `Vec<ContentBlock>` return type (with lossy-serialization warning for non-text blocks)
- `ToolResult.content` updated from `String` to `Vec<ContentBlock>`
- `RealMobRuntime::send_message` and `UnifiedRuntime::send_message` now accept `impl Into<ContentInput>`

### Fixed

- `FactoryAgentBuilder` session store forwarding — custom stores (e.g. BigQuery) are now passed through to `AgentFactory`, eliminating unnecessary JSONL fallback, redb lock contention, and duplicate persistence

## [0.4.11] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- Bump all meerkat crate dependencies to 0.4.11
- Map `SessionError::Unsupported` to HTTP 422 in SSE and interaction endpoints
- `/interactions/stream` is now observe-only (message sending stays in `mobkit/send_message` RPC)
- `NotExternallyAddressable` errors return 403 instead of 500
- Renamed all `phase*` files to semantic names (34 files: binaries, tests, docs)
- `validate_phase0_governance_contracts` deprecated in favor of `validate_governance_contracts`

### Added

- `mobkit/models/catalog` RPC method in both standard and unified dispatchers
- Python SDK: `CatalogEntry`, `ProviderDefaults`, `ModelsCatalogResult` types
- Python SDK: `models_catalog()` on sync/async typed clients and `MobHandle`
- `InteractionComplete`/`InteractionFailed` as terminal SSE events
- Console live snapshot derives `loaded_modules` from discovered agents

### Fixed

- Console live snapshot `loaded_modules` was hard-coded to empty
- `phase_g` test: corrected `repo_root()` path, `.js` → `.cjs` refs, NVM PATH resolution

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-13

First public release. Version aligned with Meerkat v0.4.8.

### Added

- Rust crate `meerkat-mobkit` published to crates.io

- Gateway binary builds for 5 platforms (linux x86/arm, macOS x86/arm, Windows)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions: fmt, clippy, test, audit, release)
- Release workflow with automated registry publishing
- Comprehensive clippy lint config (pedantic + deny unwrap/expect/panic)
- Pre-commit hooks (fmt on commit, gitleaks + clippy + tests on push)
- cargo-deny security auditing
- Version parity scripts across Rust, Python, and TypeScript
- Documentation site with architecture overview, quickstart, API reference
- MobKit logo and architecture diagram

### Changed

- Crate renamed from `meerkat-mobkit-core` to `meerkat-mobkit`
- Crate layout flattened (`crates/meerkat-mobkit-core/` → `meerkat-mobkit/`)
- TypeScript SDK renamed from `@meerkat/mobkit-sdk` to `@rkat/mobkit-sdk`
- Edition upgraded to 2024, rust-version to 1.94.0
- Meerkat dependencies bumped to 0.4.8 (resolved from crates.io)
- `spawn_many` now runs concurrently via `futures::try_join_all`
- RPC mob handlers extracted to `rpc/mob_methods.rs`
- Event log type aliases (`EventLogError`, `EventFilter`)
- Python SDK: `ensure_member()` and `find_members()` return typed `MemberSnapshot`
- Python SDK: `send()` returns `SendMessageResult` with `session_id`
