# Contributing to MobKit

Thank you for considering contributing to MobKit.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024)
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for console and TypeScript SDK)

### Building

All Rust commands use `scripts/repo-cargo`, which isolates `CARGO_HOME` and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per repo/worktree. The Makefile calls it automatically.

```bash
# Via Makefile (preferred)
make check
make build

# Or directly
./scripts/repo-cargo check --workspace
./scripts/repo-cargo build --workspace

# Python (no build step — pure Python)
PYTHONPATH=sdk/python python3 -c "import meerkat_mobkit; print('OK')"
```

### Testing

```bash
# Via Makefile (preferred)
make test          # Rust tests
make test-python   # Python tests
make test-all      # Both

# Or directly
./scripts/repo-cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'not test(governance_contracts)' --no-fail-fast

# Python
PYTHONPATH=sdk/python python3 -m pytest sdk/python/tests/ -v
```

## Branch Conventions

- `main` — stable, PRs merge here
- `feat/<name>` — new features
- `fix/<name>` — bug fixes
- `docs/<name>` — documentation
- `refactor/<name>` — non-functional refactoring

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages
3. Ensure all tests pass (`make test-all`)
4. Open a PR against `main` with a description of changes

## Code Style

- **Rust**: `make fmt` for formatting, `make lint` for clippy
- **Python**: Type annotations required on all public functions

## Releases: protocol v1

**Tag pushes validate only. They do not build or publish.** Publication requires
an explicit selection of accepted, immutable candidate artifacts. `make release`
still means a local optimized build; it is not a publication command.

Prepare the release-version/dependency changes in a PR, merge it, and wait for
successful `ci.yml` **push-to-main** CI on the exact merged commit. Candidate
production must run from that final commit, not a PR head or an earlier build.

```bash
# Dispatch from main; refuse if GitHub's dispatch SHA differs from SOURCE_SHA.
make release-candidate SOURCE_SHA=<full-merged-commit-sha>
```

The existing release workflow builds all five targets and all three executables,
checks Linux portability, signs macOS executables, and packages them once.
Candidate mode never runs GitHub release, registry, or documentation publishers.
Archive versions come from the pinned workspace, not the branch name.

The completed candidate run's summary contains a versioned JSON selection.
Save it unchanged outside the repository, for example as `accepted-candidate.json`.
It binds the repository, run and attempt, immutable manifest artifact ID and ZIP
digest, and manifest file hash. The attested manifest binds the exact source,
version, CI evidence, all five target artifact identities, and all 15 archive
and inner-executable hashes. The manifest's own artifact identity is outside the
manifest to avoid a self-referential hash.

Inner members follow the unchanged producer: Unix archives contain the executable
basename, and Windows ZIPs contain exactly
`target/<exact-target>/release/<exact-binary>.exe`. These paths are derived from
the supported target/binary inventory, never chosen by the manifest. Other nested
paths, links, duplicate members, and extra files are refused.

The selection has this strict shape (use the actual values emitted by the run,
not placeholders). IDs are integers; digests are 64 lowercase hex characters:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "accepted-candidate",
  "repository": "lukacf/meerkat-mobkit",
  "run_id": 123,
  "run_attempt": 1,
  "manifest_artifact": {
    "id": 456,
    "digest": "<artifact ZIP SHA-256>",
    "manifest_sha256": "<candidate-manifest.json SHA-256>"
  }
}
```

Give consumers the selected artifacts and hashes for acceptance. Acceptance is
external to this workflow; the workflow does not claim to have performed consumer
tests. If the source, run, attempt, archives, or signed executable bytes change,
obtain a new candidate selection and repeat acceptance.

After acceptance, the release owner creates `vX.Y.Z` on the **same merged source
SHA**. Its automatic workflow validates the tag and exact-main CI only. The owner
then explicitly promotes the accepted selection:

```bash
make release-promote RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z \
  ARTIFACT_SELECTION=/absolute/path/accepted-candidate.json

# Asset-only promotion (no registries or docs):
make release-promote RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z \
  ARTIFACT_SELECTION=/absolute/path/accepted-candidate.json \
  PUBLISH_RELEASE_PACKAGES=false

# Verify the selected candidate and exercise package dry-runs; publish nothing:
make release-promote RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z \
  ARTIFACT_SELECTION=/absolute/path/accepted-candidate.json \
  REGISTRY_DRY_RUN=true
```

Promotion verifies the original signed provenance, including the certificate's
source digest and workflow identity, run/attempt, artifact ZIP digests, archive
hashes, and every inner executable hash. It copies the original archives, index,
and checksums without rebuilding, signing, stripping, or recompressing anything.
A tag mismatch, missing/expired artifact, changed attempt, or failed verification
refuses publication; there is no fallback build. Do not rerun an accepted
candidate's jobs and assume the old selection still applies.

Real publication proceeds in order: verified public binary assets, Python and
TypeScript packages, Rust crate, exact registry readback, then immutable docs.
New releases retain the original candidate manifest, selection, and provenance
proofs. Existing flat `index.json` and `checksums.sha256` keep their archive-only
contract.

### Recovery without replacing published bytes

```bash
# Registry-only retry against an explicit existing tag:
make release-registry-retry RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z

# Registry-only dry-run; no GitHub asset mutation:
make release-registry-retry RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z REGISTRY_DRY_RUN=true

# Add explicitly selected missing ORIGINAL assets to an existing release:
make release-assets-recover RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z \
  ARTIFACT_SELECTION=/absolute/path/original-artifacts.json
```

Registry retries read back the complete published asset set and never invoke the
GitHub asset publisher. Complete candidate-era releases retain sufficient public
proof for registry retries after Actions artifact expiry. Legacy releases are not
retroactively assigned candidate receipts.

Asset recovery accepts the original accepted-candidate selection, or a versioned
`original-assets` selection for a legacy release. Legacy selections explicitly
name the source/version, original run/attempt and artifact IDs/ZIP digests, and
missing archive names with outer/inner hashes. Their signed source provenance must
match the existing tag and original release index/checksums. This is not permission
to create a release or rebuild a historical binary.

Legacy ZIPs may omit a retained provenance bundle. Only that legacy recovery path
can retrieve the original signed attestation from GitHub instead. An invalid
retained bundle does not trigger fallback, and accepted candidates always require
their retained original bundles.

The legacy selection uses the following shape. `metadata` hashes identify the
existing release metadata; `artifacts` identifies original Actions ZIPs, not
GitHub release asset IDs. List only the archives explicitly authorized for
addition, even when the original ZIP also contains sibling binaries:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "original-assets",
  "repository": "lukacf/meerkat-mobkit",
  "source_sha": "<full tagged source SHA>",
  "version": "0.8.31",
  "tag": "v0.8.31",
  "run_id": 123,
  "run_attempt": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "index.json": "<original SHA-256>",
    "checksums.sha256": "<original SHA-256>"
  },
  "artifacts": [{
    "id": 456,
    "name": "<original Actions artifact name>",
    "digest": "<original artifact ZIP SHA-256>",
    "target": "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
    "archives": [{
      "name": "mobkit-rpc-gateway-0.8.31-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip",
      "target": "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
      "binary": "rpc_gateway",
      "size": 1234,
      "sha256": "<original archive SHA-256>",
      "inner": {
        "name": "target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/rpc_gateway.exe",
        "size": 5678,
        "sha256": "<original executable SHA-256>"
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

Uploads are add-only: a matching existing file is a no-op; any conflicting hash
refuses before writes. Never delete or replace published assets, including the
existing `v0.8.31` Windows archives. Missing originals, absent original provenance,
or missing legacy index/checksums with no original-byte source require explicit
operator intervention, not regeneration. A partial draft with no matching
selection receipt similarly requires explicit owner cleanup.

All supported recovery runs use the current workflow on `main`, with the old tag
as an explicit input. **Do not rerun historical release jobs or re-push old tags.**
GitHub reruns historical workflow code; the new safeguards cannot rewrite those
old snapshots.

### Dispatch modes and publication booleans

The workflow's safe default mode is `existing`. `release_tag` by itself no longer
builds or publishes assets. `P` means `publish_release_packages`, and `D` means
`registry_dry_run`. Any required-field/schema/source validation failure refuses.

| Event / mode | Inputs | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tag push | All dispatch inputs ignored | Validation only; no binary/package builds or publication |
| `candidate` | Exact source; P=false, D=false | Candidate build only |
| `candidate` | P=true or D=true | Refuse contradictory publication inputs |
| `promote` | Tag + selection; P=false, D=false | Publish original assets only |
| `promote` | Tag + selection; P=true, D=false | Assets, registries, then docs |
| `promote` | Tag + selection; P=false, D=true | Candidate verification only |
| `promote` | Tag + selection; P=true, D=true | Candidate verification + package dry-runs; no publication |
| `existing` | Tag; P=true, D=false | Registry retry after public asset verification; then docs |
| `existing` | Tag; P=true, D=true | Tagged package dry-runs only |
| `existing` | P=false, either D | Validation only |
| `existing` | No tag; P=true, D=true | Pure package dry-run; the only exact-main CI exemption |
| `existing` | No tag; P=true, D=false | Refuse untagged publication |
| `assets` | Existing release/tag + original selection; P=false, D=false | Add selected missing original assets only |
| `assets` | P=true or D=true | Refuse ambiguous recovery inputs |

Facade commands use the owner's `gh` authentication, with `GH_TOKEN` and
`GITHUB_API_TOKEN` removed from the local dispatch subprocess environment. Workflow
jobs use their scoped GitHub token. No facade command creates a tag or selects a
candidate by "latest successful" run.
