"""Real-API end-to-end: SDK option -> gateway -> real LLM turn -> observable.

Every test here boots the real ``rpc_gateway`` through the Python SDK, runs a
REAL provider turn, and asserts a POSITIVE observable that only exists if the
whole chain worked. This is the lane for the defect class HomeCore found on
2026-09-03: an option accepted by the SDK and the gateway that changed nothing
at turn time, invisible to every unit test because the unit tests stop at the
parser and the observable lives in a store written during a real turn.

Rules for tests in this file:
  - assert a positive observable (a row, a value), never "no error"
  - carry a negative control where one is cheap, so the assertion is proven
    to discriminate in the same run
  - bounded polling; the bound is generous because the LLM is real and the
    test is about correctness, not latency

Run:  make e2e-live            (builds rpc_gateway, exports MOBKIT_GATEWAY_BIN)
Cost: three short turns on the model named by MOBKIT_E2E_LIVE_MODEL
      (default claude-sonnet-4-6).
