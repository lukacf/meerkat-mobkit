"""Runtime-store durability declaration for MobKit runtime.

The gateway's runtime store (``runtime.sqlite`` — session resume, archive,
retire) is persistent SQLite by default and needs no configuration. Since
the storage-unification arc (M4) a failed open is a **startup error**, not
a silent fall-back to an in-memory twin; the only way to run in-memory on
a persistent launch is the explicit declaration this module produces:

    MobKit.builder().runtime_store(runtime_store.memory())

which serializes to the ``runtime_options.runtime_store =
{"storage": "memory"}`` wire form. Sessions then do not survive gateway
restart, and the choice is visible in the storage census
(``mobkit/status`` → ``storage.slots``).
